description: <p>Thompson Guard Station is located in the Big Belt Mountain Range in Helena National Forest. Historical records indicate that the guard station was built in 1954 for  rangers in the district, but it may have been used as a cookhouse for a Civilian Conservation Corps camp prior to that date. In later years, engineering and road  maintenance crews used the cabin as lodging.</p><p>Today, the cabin is a rustic getaway for guests seeking relaxation and recreation in west-central Montana. It is accessible by car, but snow closes the road in  winter and access is maintained to within about 4 miles of the cabin on the east side. During these periods, guests should be prepared to reach the cabin by snowshoes,  cross-country skis or snowmobile. The cabin offers many amenities, but guests must bring some of their own gear and supplies.</p>
drivingDirection: '<p>From White Sulphur Springs, travel west on Highway 360 for 1.6 miles. At this point, make a sharp curve to the right off the highway. There is a Forest Service sign at this junction that reads: Gipsy Lake 14, Townsend 44. Go straight onto the gravel road for 6.5 miles. At 6.5 miles, the gravel road forks at the entrance to a ranch. Stay to the right. As you drive the next 7.5 miles to the Forest boundary, the road will become more primitive. Within a quarter of a mile of the Forest boundary, a sign for Thompson Station will direct you to the right onto Forest Road #383. Take Forest Road #383 for 0.6 miles to a sign that will direct you to the left, and to a gate to the station.   Access to the cabin during the summer months is good and can be reached by driving through White Sulphur Springs or from the west over Duck Creek Pass.  The Forest Service does not provide snow removal to the cabin. During winter, snow closes the road and access is maintained to within about 4 miles of the cabin on the east side. Access to the cabin is by snowshoes, cross-country skis, or snowmobile. Generally, the road will open around the first week in June.</p>'
facilitiesDescription: <p>The guard station is furnished with 4 sets of bunkbeds with mattresses to accommodate up to 8 people. The cabin has a Monarch cook stove, propane lanterns, propane stove and a wood heat stove. Other amenities include a table and chairs, cleaning supplies, dishes, utensils and cookware.</p><p> An outhouse with vault toilet, picnic table and a campfire ring are near the cabin. An axe and snow shovel are provided. Firewood may be available, but it is not guaranteed. There is a fenced corral  just below the cabin.</p><p>The cabin does not have electricity, running water or indoor plumbing. Guests must bring a sufficient amount of water for drinking, cooking and washing. Fuel is not provided for the propane lanterns or stove, so guests should bring 1 or 2 small propane cylinders, along with backup lighting.</p><p>Guests need to provide their own sleeping bags, linens, towels, dish soap, matches, first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. All trash and food should be packed  out, and guests are expected to clean the cabin before leaving.</p>
