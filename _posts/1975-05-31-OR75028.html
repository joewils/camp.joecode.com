description: <p>Timpanogas Shelter sits on shore of its namesake lake at an altitude of 5,300 feet in the Willamette National Forest within the Oregon Cascades Recreation Area. The cabin was patterned after the old Civilian Conservation Corps 3-sided shelter and was built in 1991 with the help of a University of Oregon outdoor school class and the Walker Rim Snowmobile Club.</p><p>The cabin is typically open from late June through late October. It is accessible by car, but the last 7 miles of the road are rough and narrow.</p>
drivingDirection: <p>From I-5, take Exit 188A onto Highway 58 and proceed just past MP 37 (east of Oakridge), turning right onto Kitson Springs Road. Proceed 0.5 mile to junction with Forest Service Road (FSR) 21, also signed as Diamond Drive. Turn right onto FSR 21 and continue approximately 32 miles, turning left onto paved FSR 2154. Continue on FSR 2154 approximately 10 miles (pavement ends at the 3.4 MP). Watch for a gate on the left side of an unmarked spur, just after a switchback. If you reach the road into the campground, you&apos;ve driven too far.</p>

orientationDescription: <p>The cabin is situated in a mountainous and heavily forested area where it is possible to see Diamond Peak, Sawtooth and Cowhorn Mountains. Timpanogas Lake is just one of several alpine lakes in the area.</p><p>Willamette National Forest offers prime habitat for such species as Roosevelt elk, black bear, northern bald eagles, mule deer and bobcats, among other wildlife.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Anglers enjoy fishing for brook trout and cutthroat on upper and lower Timpanogas Lakes, even though the lakes are closed to motorcraft. Canoeing is also possible on the lakes.</p><p>Those not inclined to fish can enjoy hiking or mountain biking on numerous trails in the Timpanogas area, especially in late August when huckleberries are ripe for picking. This includes the Timpanogas Lake Trail, which starts at the Timpanogas Campground.</p><p>The Diamond Peak Trail Area, Pacific Crest Trail and Diamond Peak Wilderness are also nearby.</p>
