sub_title: A wonderful hike just outside of the town of Corvallis with views over the City below.
overview: <p>This is a great hike or bike ride just outside of town.  You'll have great views from the top over Corvallis and towards Mary's Peak to the west.  I commonly bike this and it is a great trail for beginners to mountain biking as the trails are open year round, well maintained, and not technical. </p>
tips: |-
  <p>Trailhead:
  Follow 99 north out of town and turn left onto Walnut blvd headed west.  Take a right onto Highland and drive about a quarter mile until you see Lester Ave on the left.  Take that left and continue to the end of the road to the parking area. </p>
