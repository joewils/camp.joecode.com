orientationDescription: <p>Rugged peaks, scenic rivers and abundant wildlife define the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and surrounding designated wilderness areas. On a clear day visitors can see Mt. Baker, which rises to an elevation of 10,781 feet. The active volcano is perpetually snow-capped. Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.</p><p>Wildlife in the area ranges from mountain goats in the higher elevations to pine marten and porcupine on the forest floor. Migratory birds and native fish find ample habitat in the varied ecosystems as well.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Baker Lake covers 4,800 acres and is a popular boating, water skiing, swimming and fishing location. A variety of fish can be found in the lake, including Kokanee and Chinook salmon, and Dolly Varden, steelhead and rainbow trout. A boat ramp is located within the campground.</p><p>Hikers and backpackers are especially fortunate to have access to a variety of spectacular trails near the campground and in the surrounding area, including the family-friendly Baker Lake Trail. It begins in a stand of Douglas fir, which grew in place of an old-growth cedar forest destroyed by a fire in 1843, caused by a small eruption of Mt. Baker. Many burned snags still remain. The trail meanders above the eastern shoreline of Baker Lake, offering glimpses of Mt. Baker along the way.</p>
