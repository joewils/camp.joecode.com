sub_title: 10.3 mile trail near Newport Coast, California
overview: <p>Bommer Ridge to Crystal Cove is about 10.3 miles long and located near Newport Coast, California. The trail is great for hiking and normally takes a half day.</p><p>Started at Ridge Park  ( off Newport Coast Dr., Newport Beach CA - drive to end). </p><p>It's a popular area on the weekends, so do NOT wear headphones - you need to hear bikers and runners as they approach you from behind. We took Bommer Ridge to Moro Ridge. &nbsp;There is a generic map on web, but the map posted along the trails showed more trails than the map on the web. It got a little confusing (thankfully they post a &quot;You are here&quot; button on their maps), but basically we followed the Bommer Ridge trail that was wide and did not veer off to the narrow paths. &nbsp;You can see in photos 6 and 8, the discrepancy. &nbsp;My descriptions to you are based on the web map (photo 8).</p><p>We passed Upper and Lower Moro Campgrounds (which looked pretty desolate), down to the Moro Campground. &nbsp;Our starting elevation was at about 1000 feet, and we went down to 0, which was at the Moro Campground. Here, there is a nice ranger station, with maps and bathrooms, and resting areas. </p><p>Then of course, we climbed back up via No Dog and No Name Ridge to complete our loop. &nbsp;This track was moderately strenuous. </p><p>(there are 3 icons in the lower right corner of the map, slideshow mode - statistics mode and &nbsp;settings. &nbsp;Click on Statistic mode to see elevation and speed throughout the hike).</p><p>For 6 miles more, you can start down in Shady Canyon's Bommer Canyon parking lot. See my guide on Bommer Meadow. &nbsp;From Bommer Canyon parking, it's 3 miles up to Park Ridge, so that would add a total of 6 miles to this hike, if you are testing your endurance levels. </p>
tips: <p>IF you start in morning with clouds, they can clear up. &nbsp;Dress in layers, and bring a hat. For 10 miles, I suggest plenty of water, and perhaps a banana or apple or tangerine snack.</p><p>Steep inclines and declines - if you have knee problems, bring your trekking poles.</p><p>There are outhouses along the way, and it's a nice rear stop at Ranger station at Moro Campground.  Beautiful views of coastline.</p><p>Be in good shape. Last photo shows you the site at our finish point....someone need help on the trai.  Come prepared, you don't want this scene for yourself. </p>
