overview: <p>A great short hike to amazing views.. On top of Hawk Mountain the only thing that remains is the old cabin. The site was developed in 1919 with a 60' three-legged timber platform tower and a frame cabin (still there). The site was abandoned in the 1950's. </p>
tips: <p>At 5277' the snow should be gone by late July most years, but you should always be prepared. In August the huckleberries should be available making for a nice trailside snack. From forest road 46, take forest road 6350 to forest road 6355 turn left here, shortly after you turn on to forest road 6355 there will be a trailhead on your right. Once on the trail continue for 1.75 miles, you will come to a meadow on your left and the spur trail to the summit will be to your right, from this point it will be about 0.3 miles to the summit, this will be the biggest climb but it's not too bad. </p>
