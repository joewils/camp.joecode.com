sub_title: This short drive up this 4,500 foot Butte that sits above the Lava Lands Visitor Center
overview: <p>This guide will take you up Lava Butte and to the Lava Lands Visitor Center in Newberry Crater National Monument.  There is a great visitor center to explore and a short interpretive trail you can take.  The geology of the area is really fascinating.  Instead of trying to explain it all here I will leave it to the interpretive signs and the visitor center. </p>
tips: <p>The visitor center is 11.7 miles south from Bend on Highway 97.   There is a $5 day pass fee to explore the area if you don't have a Northwest Forest Service Permit. </p>
