sub_title: 'A short interpretive loop hike around the inside of the volcanic tuff ring of the State Natural Area. '
overview: <p>In this guide you will explore the inside of the Fort Rock State Natural Area.  This volcanic rock formation was formed 50,000 to 100,000 years ago as lava rose to the surface under an ancient sea.  Over time after the rock solidified waves crashing against the southeast side of the volcanic tuff rim wore it away leaving you an entrance to explore!  Bring a camera and take the time to read all the interpretive signs along the way. </p>
tips: <p>From Bend Drive South on 97 to the small town of La Pine.  Just past the town take a left onto Route 31.  Drive 29.2 miles on 31 until you see county road 5-10 (Fort Rock Road).  Take a left onto this road and continue for another 6 miles until you see the parking area for Fort Rock. </p>
