title: Mt. Clemen - Waterworks Canyon
seo_title: mt-clemen-waterworks-canyon
sub_title: Easy to start, challenging to finish.  Be prepared to scramble talus and negotiate underbrush!
overview: <p>The lower part of this trail is overwhelmingly deceptive.  There is a decent parking area that is well enough removed from the highway, and the trail-head is usually in good shape.  Unfortunately, the &quot;trail&quot; only goes about half-way up the hill.  After crossing under the brush a few times, the trail kind of disappears and leaves the hiker with the options of following game-trails, forging their own, or just turning around.  </p><p>The game trails (if you can find/follow them) are usually a relatively safe option, but will quite often involve some talus-slope scrambling.  It is usually easier on the ascent to just climb up to a ridge and follow it up to the summit rather than staying in the canyon itself.  Of course, the decent is more of the same nastiness of sorting out the &quot;easiest&quot; path back down through the talus and brush.</p><p>The views from the top are excellent, and worth the effort on a clear day.  And the overall distance and grade of the hike is great training for higher elevation mountains (it is a similar profile to the climb from Paradise-to-Muir on Rainier. </p><p>If you have an adventurous dog who will go anywhere, this is a good challenging hike to wear them out.  If your dog has soft/sensitive feet, is prone to getting brush stuck in their fur, or is nervous scrambling on loose rock, it would be better to leave them at home. </p>
tips: <p>Bring plenty of water.  Although the name is &quot;Waterworks Canyon,&quot; the water in the canyon can be quite sparse, and almost non-existent on the upper part of the hike.  You can filter water from the stream, but only if it was water in it (not likely in late summer)!</p><p>Be Prepared for ticks and rattlesnakes.  Both are quite common along the trail. </p>
