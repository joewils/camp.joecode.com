orientationDescription: <p>Spanning southern Washington and northern Oregon, from the mouths of Sandy River to the Deschutes River, the Columbia River Gorge is unique in both its natural and cultural history, as well as its designation as a National Scenic Area. It is a spectacular river canyon, 80 miles long and up to 4,000 feet deep, cutting the only sea level route through the Cascade Mountain Range.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The Eagle Recreation Area, just a short walk or bike ride away, provides visitors with opportunities for picnicking, hiking and wildlife viewing.</p><p>Bonneville Dam, about a mile west of the campground, features sturgeon ponds, fish viewing and a visitor&amp;#39;s center. Visitors will find display ponds showcasing large rainbow trout and adult white sturgeon measuring more than ten feet long. Interpretive displays offer visitors insight into the history and construction of the dam and its impact on the surrounding areas.</p><p>The Eagle Creek Trail is the most popular trail in the Columbia Gorge, offering spectacular viewpoints and waterfalls. The relatively easy trail follows Eagle Creek through the forest and along paths carved into basalt cliffs. Notable stopping points include Punch Bowl Falls, where water spills 100 feet into a blue-green pool set in a large grotto, High Bridge, which traverses the gorge 150 feet above the creek and Tunnel Falls, where the trail passes through a tunnel behind the shower of falling water. This trail is part of a multi-day loop opportunity which continues into the Mark O. Hatfield Wilderness in the Mt. Hood National Forest.</p>
