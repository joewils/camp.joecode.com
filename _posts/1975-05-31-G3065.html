sub_title: Get off the usual Marys Peak trails and check out a quiet path through lush Douglass Fir forests
overview: <p>The Marys River watershed starts on the upper slopes of Marys Peak, in western Benton county. The forest here is mainly Douglass fir and Noble fir, with understories of maple and rhododendron. In the spring and early summer, wildflowers are everywhere. </p><p>This old access road allows for quick travel over a steady, clear surface. You can extend the hike further, but the road is not maintained and there may be washouts further along the path than this guide extends. In the past, the road connected through to the north side of Marys Peak on another logging road. </p>
tips: <p>Be aware of a certain local species of bird. You may never see one, but its song sounds exactly like a hikers distress whistle, which has lead to many false alarms. </p>
