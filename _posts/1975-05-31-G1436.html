sub_title: Via the PCT and the West Ridge with a truly unbelievable ski descent back to your vehicle
overview: <p>This is a fantastic ski mountaineering trip.  One of the few where you can ski directly back to your vehicle without much pushing involved with your poles.  It was winter so the gps track here follows the actual trail very well but may be a couple hundred feet off from the trail on the ascent.  On the descent we went wherever the good snow was but kept close to our ascent track to return directly to our car.   The summit is about an 80 foot steep spire that is not advisable to climb if there is snow and ice without a rope.  It's got a ton of exposure and a fall would be deadly.  When you get to the base of it, you'll see that it is not skiable anyway.  Near the top be aware that there will be cornices so stay away from any edges. </p>
tips: <p>The trailhead is directly across the street from Diamond Lake off of Route 138.  You will need a Northwest Forest Pass to park here. </p>
