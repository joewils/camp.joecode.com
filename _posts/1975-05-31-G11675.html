sub_title: A nice swimming hole with an easy trail, but driving to the trail head is difficult.
overview: <p>I heard this spot is one of the great swimming holes in Oregon.&nbsp; I really had no idea how difficult it is to get to the trail head.I tried on two previous occasions to go on this hike and both times was stopped about 10 miles from the trail head by massive snow on the road.&nbsp; Even this time we barely made it to the trailhead as there was a massive bolder in the road that we were just able to squeeze past.</p><p>The road is really sketchy and not for the faint of heart as it's littered with rocks from the canyon all around, and some sections look like they are ready to slide off the mountain.</p><p>Once we finally found the trailhead it really is a nice hike.&nbsp; There is a wooden shelter that you could camp at just before the swimming hole.&nbsp; </p><p>There isn't a bridge so if you want to continue on the trail you will need to ford the creek.&nbsp; It was a bout waist deep when we went, but I heard in late summer it's pretty easy to ford.&nbsp; </p><p>Do note that there was heavy snow fall in 2010/2011 so your results may vary. </p>
tips: "<p>The road to this hike can be pretty scary with boulders littering the roadway.  When we went we had to stop and move rocks, as well as drive around boulders.</p><p>To get take Hwy 20 east to just past milepost 52. Turn north on Soda Fork Road (#2041).  \nAt 7.6 miles you will come to a six-way intersection.  Head straight to remain on #2401.\nIn another 4.4 miles you will reach a 3-way junction.  Take the middle road 646.\n.7 miles down this road you will find a parking area and the trail head.</p><p>Make sure you check out the Sweet Home Ranger District webpage as they are really good at updating information on roads in their area. </p>"
