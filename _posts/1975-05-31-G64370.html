overview: |-
  <p>The United States Congress designated the Big Jacks Creek Wilderness in 2009 and it now has a total of 52,684 acres. All of this wilderness is located in Idaho and is managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The Big Jacks Creek Wilderness is bordered by the Little Jacks Creek Wilderness to the northwest. They are separated by a natural gas pipe line and dirt road.</p><p>
  The wilderness, in the Big Jacks Creek Basin, consists of rugged canyons, streams and plateaus that provide habitat for redband trout, mountain quail, sage hens, mountain lions, mule deer, antelope, bobcats, coyotes, and bighorn sheep, as well as two sensitive plant species. The basin ranges in elevation from 2808 to 5872 feet and drains a sagebrush-covered plateau dissected by rugged, sheer-walled canyons that are as much as 655 feet deep. Big Jacks Creek flows north into the Bruneau River, a tributary of the Snake River.</p><p>The basin is covered by big sagebrush, low sagebrush, salt desert shrub, and riparian vegetation communities. The sagebrush communities are most common; low sagebrush types are found primarily on shallow, poorly drained soil, and big sagebrush types are associated with deep, well-drained soils.</p><p>Lush riparian vegetation grows along perennial reaches of the creek and generally includes shrubs of willow, rose, and currant as well as sedge and bluegrass in meadow areas. Poison Ivy is abundant in the riparian areas. Beaver colonies are also found along the waterways.</p><p>Access to the basin is by way of a network of dirt roads in the southern part of the basin and hiking trails in the wilderness. The Parker Trail is the only mapped hiking trail into the wilderness. Other trails fall into the game/stock trail category. </p>
tips: |-
  <p>This area is isolated and no services are available. Anything you might need should be brought with you. There is no cell phone service and the area is not regularly patrolled by law enforcement. You are on your own!</p><p>The dirt roads in the area range from bad to really bad. Except for the gas pipeline and the Battle Creek-Wickahoney roads, 4 wheel drive vehicles are recommended. The roads are impassible when wet.</p><p>Most of the tracks on the map are on the border of the wilderness or are corridors surrounded by wilderness. There are three access points to the wilderness shown as POIs/tracks on the map. They are all south of Bruneau, Idaho on Highway 51 on the west side of the highway. I listed the access points with my order of priority with POI #1 having the best access, ect.</p><p>There are no developed campgrounds in the area. Primitive camping is allowed. The camping areas listed in this guide fit that description.</p><p>The best times to visit the area are in late fall and in early spring. It gets hot in summer time and winter usually brings snow. The snakes are out in late spring and are starting to den in early fall. This is great rattlesnake habitat.
