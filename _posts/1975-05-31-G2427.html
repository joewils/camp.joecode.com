overview: '<p>The Yakso Falls Trail passes through an old-growth forest which has been selective logged and has many wildflowers during the early spring. Rhododendrons are plentiful and the waterfall is approximately 70 feet high.</p><p>EDITOR''S NOTE:  When we did this hike it was getting really late and we weren''t able to get any pictures of the waterfall.  If you go here please upload your trip to Everytrail and leave a Review on this guide so we can update it with your pictures.</p><p> </p>'
tips: <p>At milepost 16 on Hwy. 138, turn south on Little River Road (County Road 17, turning into Forest Road 27) and follow for 25.8 miles (7 of which are gravel) to Lake-in-the-Woods Campground. Trailhead parking is at the campground entrance. The Yakso Falls Trail is across Road 27 from the campground. </p>
