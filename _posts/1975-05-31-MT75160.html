description: <p>Porcupine Cabin sits in the foothills of the Crazy Mountains at an elevation of 6,400 feet. It was built in 1914 after a previous structure burned down, and was remodeled by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1934. Since its construction, the cabin has been used as temporary housing by Forest Service rangers while they were patrolling for timber poachers, watching for fires and monitoring livestock. Today, it is available year-round to outdoor enthusiasts, offering access to a variety of activities.</p><p>Guests can drive to the cabin in the summer, but a high-clearance, four-wheel drive vehicle is recommended due to road conditions. Winter access requires snowshoeing, skiing or snowmobiling up to 2 miles from the end of the paved road.   Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.</p>

Continue 8 miles to Porcupine Road, turn east (right) and then drive another 8 miles to the cabin. Four-wheel drive vehicles are recommended due to the road condition.   During the winter, the last two miles of the road to the cabin are not plowed. Skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles are required to reach the cabin.</p>
