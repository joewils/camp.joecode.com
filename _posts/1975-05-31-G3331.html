sub_title: Hike unmarked roads and trails to an incredible view of Jasper Valley and Thurston.
overview: <p>Up in the Thurston Hills, past the Mountain Gate housing developments are two small hills.  The smaller one has a nice viewpoint about half way up, but the summit is covered in trees.  Overall this small hill is not really worth climbing.</p><p>The climb up the larger hill is much more rewarding with one wide open view of Jasper Valley from one viewpoint, and Thurston from a second viewpoint.  There is also a grove of madrone at the top of the larger hill.</p><p>Neither of these hills has nice trails.  You will have to find your way along dirt roads and faint trails.  Stick to the path from this guide and you'll make it to the top. </p>
tips: <p>To get here take Hwy 126 east from I-5 in Springfield all the way to Main Street.  Turn left at the light.  Drive East and turn right on 67th St. Turn left at 66th Pl and follow to a dead end.</p><p>The hike up the larger hill gets pretty steep at the very top, and if it's been raining is very slick. </p>
