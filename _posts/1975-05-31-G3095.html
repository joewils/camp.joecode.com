sub_title: 'With views of the Olympic Range, Puget Sound, and Vancouver Island, this hike is one to remember. '
overview: <p>Hurricane Hill provides a quick hike out from the Hurricane Ridge Visitors Center to a small summit with 360deg panoramic views of Puget Sound, the Olympic Range, and Vancouver Island.</p><p>As with seemingly any alpine hike, watch out for the rodents. The chipmunks and ground squirrels here are bold, climbing onto and into any pack left unattended. The other common rodent, the marmot, is also present - though less demanding. You can often find them sunning themselves on rocks or packing away grass and plant material for nests and food over the winter. </p><p>Occasionally, you'll run across other wildlife, such as chukkar partridges and deer. </p>
tips: <p>Choose a warm day or be ready for the worst, the summit is exposed to the full fury of the Hurricane Ridge weather. </p>
