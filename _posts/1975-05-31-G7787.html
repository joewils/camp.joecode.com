sub_title: Scenic mines, campground, and trails near Burgdorf, Idaho.
overview: "<p>This is a historic mining area along the south side of the Salmon River near Burgdorf, Idaho. There are also some active mines in the area. The Frank Church - River of No Return Wilderness borders this district on the north and east. The elevation ranges from about 6000' to 8500'.</p><p>Most of the mines are private property and the owners wishes should be respected. It also indicates that access could be changed at any time.</p><p>My GPS tracks in the mining area are kind of scrambled, probably due to the steep terrain and trees, but all follow roads/trails. If the track indicates going over the side of the mountain, stay on the road next to it!</p><p>There are more mines, shafts, and structures in this immediate area that I have not explored, but these will get you started.</p><p>Mine shafts and structures should not be entered due to the danger that old dynamite and chemicals could be stored within. There is also a danger of cave-ins due to decayed timber in the mines. Be careful!</p><p>The main road (FR 318) to the mining area can be traveled by automobile, but a high clearance vehicle is better. Off FR 318 a high clearance vehicle is recommended, with a 4X4 being a better option. ATVs are better yet. \n  </p><p>There is no cell phone service in this area. </p>"
tips: '<p>Depending on the seasons'' snowfall, the trails are usually clear by July and open through September, sometimes a little longer. It gets cold in October.</p><p>Downed timber can block roads/trails at any time. Much of this area has been burned by forest fires and some type of saw might enable you to continue the trip.</p><p>Clothing depends on the weather, but it usually freezes at night all summer. Thunder storms are possible at any time. </p><p>Take drinking water with you as none of the ground water in this area is safe to drink without filtering or boiling.</p><p>Wild animals, including moose, elk, deer, bear, wolves, cougars, river otters, pine marten, and others are in the area. </p><p>Be aware that wolves are very territorial and may attack any dogs with you. Moose cows with calves may attack anything. Don''t push your luck with moose! This is also &quot;Bear Country&quot;.</p><p>Read and abide by the information at the trail heads on how to interact with horses and pack stock you may encounter.</p><p>There is no cell phone service in the area.</p><p>Contact the McCall Ranger Station, Payette National Forest, Idaho, telephone #208 634-0400 for maps, fire info, and camp ground availability in the Burgdorf area. </p>'
