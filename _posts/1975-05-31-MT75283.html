description: <p>West Fork Cabin is a rustic Forest Service Guard Station located 39 miles northwest of Choteau, Montana, on the Rocky Mountain Front Range.  The cabin is a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw from the North Fork Teton River and about 3.5 miles beyond Teton Pass Ski Resort.  Open year-round, the cabin provides access to a wide range of summer and winter recreation activities such as hiking, fishing, horseback riding, cross country skiing and snowshoeing.</p><p>  This rustic cabin is accessible via paved county road, then gravel Forest Service road.  During the winter months when the ski area is operating, the Forest Service gravel road is plowed to the ski area.  Beyond that point, guests will need to ski, showshoe or snowmobile to travel the last 3.5 miles to the cabin.  The cabin is available year-round for rental, seven days a week.  Contact the Ranger District for current road conditions.</p>
drivingDirection: '<p>From Highway 89 about 5 miles north of Choteau, go west on Teton Canyon Road that becomes Forest Development Road (FDR) #144 at the Forest boundary.  Stay on this road past the ski area about 3.5 miles to the road end.  Cabin is located behind the locked gate to your left just after you cross the bridge.  In the winter the road is not plowed beyond the ski area. Guests can park in the ski area parking lot.  All vehicles parked overnight at either the snowmobile parking lot or the ski area parking lot will be issued a parking pass to put in their window by the district office when the cabin key is issued.</p>'
facilitiesDescription: <p>The single-room cabin is divided into a kitchen and dining area plus a sleeping area.  It sleeps six adults with two sets of bunk beds and two folding cots.  A vault toilet is located outside.</p><p>The cabin is heated by propane, and a limited amount of firewood is provided for the wood stove.  A propane cook stove is also included.  Although a ramp leads into the cabin and outhouse, the interior is not designed to meet accessibility standards.</p><p>No electricity or refrigerator is available so guests will need to bring coolers.  The area is covered by a special food storage regulation from March 1 through December 15 designed to minimize bear/human conflicts.  All food must be stored in bear resistant containers or inside the cabin or a hard-sided vehicle when unattended.  Water is available at a hand pump outside the cabin.  Recommended items to bring include sleeping bags, food, toilet paper, a lantern, towels, matches and first aid kit.</p>
