sub_title: 'ATV, UTV, &amp; 4X4 guide to trails, overlooks, and POIs on the northwest rim of the Bruneau-Jarbidge Rivers Wilderness. '
overview: "<p>This Wilderness was primarily established to protect &quot;whitewater&quot; rafting recreation. However, there are a lot of scenic views of the canyon from the rims and a few hiking trails into the canyon.</p><p>The United States Congress designated the Bruneau-Jarbidge Rivers Wilderness in 2009 and it now has a total of 89,777 acres. All of this wilderness is located in Idaho and is managed by the Bureau of Land Management.\n \nDescription \nThis wilderness has some of the best class V whitewater that Idaho has to offer. The Jarbidge River offers a remote and challenging 29-mile float trip taking boaters through a maze of spectacular canyons, &quot;hoo-doo&quot; rock spires, junipers and red volcanic cliffs.</p><p>The Bruneau River flows north from headwaters in the northern Nevada mountains and is known for its sheer-walled, rocky canyons and whitewater boating opportunities. The 50-mile long Bruneau River begins at the confluence of the Jarbidge River and the West Fork Bruneau River.</p><p>In the wilderness, plateaus are divided by deep, winding river canyons and provide habitats for bighorn sheep, redband trout, deer, cougar, coyotes, bobcats and river otters. </p>"
tips: |-
  <p>This area is isolated and no services are available. Anything you might need should be brought with you. There is intermittent cell phone service and the area is not regularly patrolled by law enforcement. You are on your own!</p><p>The map shows four access roads into the area. The one at Bruneau, Idaho is paved to the Bruneau River Bridge. The other three roads, all starting from Hwy #51 are crowned and graveled until nearing the Bruneau River.</p><p>The roads (all dirt) in the southern part of this guide and especially the ones leading to the overlooks are bad. DON'T GO IF IT IS WET!</p><p>Another caution: There are several roads shown on topo maps and BLM maps of this area that just don't exist. The roads in this guide do.</p><p>There are no developed campgrounds in the area. Primitive camping is allowed. </p><p>The best times to visit the area are in late fall and in early spring. It gets hot in summer time and winter usually brings snow. The snakes are out in late spring and are starting to den in early fall. This is great rattlesnake habitat. Be careful!</p><p>The links to BLM websites in the POIs are notorious for not being accessible.</p><p>Contact info for Bureau of Land Management for maps, fire info, ect.:</p><p>Bruneau Field Office
