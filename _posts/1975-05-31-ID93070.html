description: <p>Lake Cleveland Campground is a very popular summer recreational facility. Located next to its namesake, the campground is divided into the East Side and West Side loops.  Very popular with residents of local communities, the campground is often full every weekend from early July to Labor Day.</p>
drivingDirection: <p>From Interstate 84, take exit 216 and follow State Highway 77 south approximately 18 miles, through the towns of Declo and Albion, to Howell Canyon Road. Turn west at the Pomerelle Ski Area sign and drive up the canyon on Howell Canyon Road another 7 miles. The road is steep and winding. Look for an entrance sign on your right. Use caution with travel trailers and RVs, as not all campground loops are suitable for trailer turnarounds.</p>
facilitiesDescription: <p>Seventeen camping sites are located in the East campground loop, seven of which are reservable, the remaining ten are first-come, first-served.  The East side of the lake is best suited for large RVs and trailers.   Nine campsites are available on the West side of the lake on a first-come, first-served basis.  Trailers are not advised on the West side of the lake because the turn-around is very tight (limited space due to steep terrain).</p>
