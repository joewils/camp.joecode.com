The cabin opens for use in mid-summer and stays open through March, as it is most popular during hunting season.</p><p>In addition to hunting access, the facility provides ample opportunities for hiking, backpacking and horseback riding, as well as winter sports, such as snowmobiling and cross country skiing.</p><p>During most winter months, the cabin can be accessed by snowmobile, depending on conditions. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities to really enjoy their stay at Antone Cabin.</p>

orientationDescription: <p>The historic log cabin is located along the grassy foothills at the southern end of the Snowcrest Range, at an elevation of 8,100 feet. Together with the nearby Gravelly Range, the area is one of Montana&amp;#39;s most popular hunting grounds.</p><p>The two mountain ranges are home to nearly 10,000 elk and a growing population of grizzly bears (learn more about bear safety). Moose are also frequent visitors to the meadow where the cabin lies.</p><p>The large horse pasture adjacent to the cabin is for administrative use only. The public may rent the small horse corral that is next to the trailhead for an additional fee. No livestock is permitted inside the small fenced area immediately around the cabin.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>A variety of hiking, backpacking and horseback riding trails extend into the Snowcrest Range, including the Snowcrest Trail, which covers the entire range, providing panoramic views.
