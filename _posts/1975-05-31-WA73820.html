Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area, dominates the landscape on a clear day. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, the active volcano from which the forest takes its name is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.</p><p>Flowing adjacent to this campground is the Cascade River, designated as a National Scenic River. Possessing remarkable values related to wildlife, culture, recreation and scenery, the Cascade River is preserved in its free-flowing condition and cannot not dammed or impeded.</p><p>Wildlife in the area include mountain goats, coyotes, pine marten and a variety of migratory birds and native fish.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>In addition to being a prime location for hiking, fishing, picnicking, and horseback riding in summer and early fall, Mineral Park Campground offers excelent skiing and snowshoeing in the winter months.</p><p>Several trailheads for the overnight backpacker are located in the vicinity of the nearby town of Marblemount, including Hidden Lake Trail. Beginning in a forested setting, this trail climbs quickly to open meadows and grand views of the Cascade River. As it reaches higher elevations, it winds through angular slabs of granite and groupings of alpine fir. Spectacular views of high, jagged Cascade peaks can be seen from these higher meadows. Hidden Lake and the Hidden Lake Lookout can be seen from the pass, and reached by traversing down a talus slope.</p>
