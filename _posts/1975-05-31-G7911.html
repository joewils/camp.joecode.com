overview: <p>This Guide starts where the pavement ends on the Warren Wagon Road from McCall, Idaho. Here, at the &quot;Y&quot;, the graveled Warren Wagon Road continues all the way to Warren, Idaho. The graveled road to the north, goes to Burgdorf, Idaho and on to the Salmon River.</p><p>This is a very scenic area. Summit Creek parallels the paved part of the Warren Wagon Road, with meadows on both sides of the road at times. It is a good area to view big game. I have seen moose, deer, elk, bear, and wolves along this road.</p><p>Josephine Lake is a beautiful high mountain lake and it is just a short hike from the trail head. The trail is well marked.</p><p>If you see government employees at the fish counting station (Look for government license plates on vehicles there!) visit with them. Maybe you will be lucky enough to see Chinook Salmon in the creek. </p>
tips: '<p>Depending on the seasons'' snowfall, the trails are usually clear by July and open through September, sometimes a little longer. It gets cold in October.</p><p>Clothing depends on the weather, but it usually freezes at night all summer. Thunder storms are possible at any time.</p><p>Take drinking water with you as none of the ground water in this area is safe to drink without filtering or boiling.</p><p>Wild animals, including moose, elk, deer, bear, wolves, cougars, river otters, pine marten, and others are in the area. Chinook salmon spawn in the creeks, peaking in August.</p><p>Be aware that wolves are very territorial and may attack any dogs with you. Moose cows with calves may attack anything. Don''t push your luck with moose! This is also &quot;Bear Country&quot;.</p><p>Read and abide by the information at the trail heads on how to interact with horses and pack stock you may encounter.</p><p>There is no cell phone service in the area.</p><p>Contact the McCall Ranger Station, Payette National Forest, Idaho, telephone #208 634-0400 for maps, fire info, and camp ground availability. </p>'
