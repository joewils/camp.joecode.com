sub_title: via Devil's Lake T.H.
overview: <p>I got to the Devil's Lake trail head and started on the South Sister Summit trail at about 10am. &nbsp;It was hot at first in the woods but the wind was blowing like crazy about halfway up and then it started to snow. &nbsp;I almost decided not to make the summit but I did. &nbsp; Good trip but hard! </p>
tips: <p>pack super light... and expect changing conditions. &nbsp;I had a long sleeve moisture wick shirt under a short sleeved moisture wick shirt. &nbsp;On top of that (when it got cold) I had a down (thin) jacket under a gortex pac-light rain jacket. &nbsp;Overall I was good. </p>
