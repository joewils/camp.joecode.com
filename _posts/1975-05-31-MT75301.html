orientationDescription: <p>The Clark Fork River Area is bordered by the Idaho line on the west and the Cabinet Mountains Wilderness on the east. The Clark Fork River flows north and west through the District, and the Bull and Vermilion Rivers join it from the north.  Rugged peaks ranging in elevation from 6,000-8,700 feet overlook the valley bottom.   The Kootenai National Forest is dominated by a mixed conifer forest, but there is also an impressive ancient cedar grove set aside as a scenic area. In the spring and throughout the summer, a succession of wildflowers add color to hillsides and meadows and in the fall, stands of western larch and aspen mix yellows with the reds of huckleberry bushes, mountain maples and mountain ash.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The Cabinet Ranger District features almost half a million acres of National Forest lands offering a full range of year-round recreational opportunities.  Approximately 400 miles of trail are available to the hiker, hunter, and stock user to access various lakes and scenic viewpoints.  150 miles of these trails are open to motorized use. The District maintains almost 400 miles of open road, and many miles of gated roads offer additional opportunities to mountain bikers, berry pickers, and hunters.   There is a trailhead located near the lookout with access for both hiking and OHV riding. For more information on designated OHV-riding areas,  Click here . Visitors may also enjoy seasonal Huckleberry picking in the land surrounding the lookout.</p>
