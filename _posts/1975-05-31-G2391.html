sub_title: A fun and challenging mountain bike loop ride on Mary's Peak
overview: <p>This is a fun ride up a closed logging road (#2005) to a single track traverse ascent of the East Ridge and Tie Trails followed by a screaming, switchback, intense and technically challenging descent via the North Ridge Trail.  The ascent is easy up the road but the descent takes some skill to negotiate.  I'll call this a half day adventure in case it takes a bit of time to safely descend.  Enjoy! </p>
tips: |-
  <p>Directions to the North Ridge Trailhead:
  Two miles west of Hwy 34 to Hwy 20 junction in Philomath, turn off of Hwy 20 on to Woods Creek Road. Travel 7.5 miles up Woods Creek Road to the closed Forest Service gate. Trail crosses the road just inside the gate.  </p>
