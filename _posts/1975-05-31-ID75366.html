description: <p>Cold Springs Peak Cabin is a primitive log cabin that was originally constructed in 1931 to shelter firefighters and other work crews. It was last used for firefighters  in 1953.</p><p>In 1989, Forest Service employees shored up the cabin&amp;#39;s foundation, re-shingled the roof and installed a stove. Today, the 12x14-ft. cabin qualifies for inclusion in  the National Register of Historic Places.</p><p>The cabin is only accessible via multi-use trails. Pot Mountain Trail 169 is a 4-mile trail leading to the cabin, but it&amp;#39;s not recommended for off-road vehicles. Guests must be prepared to bring most of their own gear and supplies for a comfortable stay.</p>
