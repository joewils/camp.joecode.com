sub_title: Near Otter Rock explore this geological formation caused when two caves collapsed.
overview: <p>Surfers and surf watchers energize this area. During winter storms, water from the restless ocean slams with a thundering roar into a hollow rock formation shaped like a huge punch bowl. The surf churns, foams, and swirls as it mixes a violent brew. The punch bowl was probably created by the collapse of the roof over two sea caves, then shaped by wave action. </p><p>The park is a popular whale watching site and displays an intriguing geology. This is a scenic picnic spot atop the undulating rocky shoreline. Don't forget to explore the tidepools.  </p><p>Devil's Punch Bowl offers beach access and opportunities for picnicking, hiking, exploring the shoreline and viewing scenery </p>
tips: <p>Drive 8 miles north of Newport on Hwy 101 to the Devil's Punchbowl State Scenic Area turnoff.  Then follow the signs to the parking area. </p>
