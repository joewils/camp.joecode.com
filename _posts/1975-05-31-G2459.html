sub_title: A beautiful hike in Santiam Pass to a tower of rock in the Managerie Wilderness
overview: <p>This hike would be much easier if you shuttled two cars to both parking lots.  This hike starts at the easterly parking lot across the road from Fernview Campground and returns to Trout Creek Campground parking lot alongside HWY 20.  There is no trail back along the road so you will have to be careful on the walk back as there are a few blind corners.  Alternatively when you get to Rooster Rock you can return via the same trail and save some distance. </p>
tips: <p>From Sweethome drive just over 22 miles until you see the Trout Creek campground.  Continue past this several miles until you see the Fernview Campground.  Look for the trailhead parking on the left side of the road here to start the steep ascent. </p>
