sub_title: Look closely to discover pieces from the areas coal mining history along these three trails.
overview: <p>The Coal Creek Natural Area has three wonderful trails to hike, the Coal Creek, Primrose, and Lower Coal Creek Trail.  All trails will lead you up and down small ravines, through a forest of Douglas Firs, and along the Coal Creek. Along the way you will catch glimpses from the past as there are still many artifacts left over from the areas mining days. In some spots you can still catch the scent of burnt cinders while hiking down the trail.</p><p>The Coal Creek Trail is the most frequently hiked trails in the park. Its popularity comes from the variety of attractions all on a relatively short day hike. Nearly all of the best coal mining attractions are found along this trail, from the sealed mineshaft to the concrete foundations of buildings long gone. This trail has recently received many new bridges. That adds to the ease and beauty of the hike.</p><p>The Primrose Trail is a short loop off of the Coal Creek Trail. This trail offers a great hike along the creek where you will see a few of the mining artifacts left behind. Unfortunately the trail has been closed due to a portion of the trail being washed out. Hopefully with the renovations to the Coal Creek Trail, this trail will also see some work done on it.</p><p>Finally, the Lower Coal Creek Trail is one of my favorite trails in the area. The trail is used infrequently so you will often have this trail to yourself. The lack of hikers is because it is not a well known trail and to the popularity of the nearby Cougar Mountain Trails. However, this is a hidden gem that leads you along portions of Coal Creek. If you have just one hike to pick out of the three trails, I would suggest this one. </p>
tips: "<p>How to get here: </p><p>-For the Coal Creek and Primrose Trails-</p><p>From I-90 East take Exit 13 and make a right at the stop sign. Continue to follow Lakemont Blvd SE and the Red Town Trailhead parking lot will be on the left, about 3 miles away. This is also the Cougar Mountain parking area. The Coal Creek trail is just across the street from the parking area. Use caution when crossing the street as there is no cross walks.</p><p>From Interstate 405, take the Coal Creek Parkway exit which leads you to the city of Newcastle; turn left on Southeast 72nd Street and then another left onto Newcastle-Coal Creek Road. There will be a small dirt parking area about 1.8 miles from the exit. </p><p>-For the Lower Coal Creek Trail-</p><p>From I-405 take the Coal Creek Parkway Exit, head South for 1.7 miles, turn right onto SE 60th street, you will go up a curvy hill, on your right look for a small gravel parking lot. The parking lot holds 3 cars and is marked with a small sign for the nature area. You should also see a large sign for Newport Hills at the entrance.</p><p>Amenities:</p><p>-There are no restrooms in the park\n-No water fountains, bring your own water or a water purifier if using the creeks water\n-I suggest bringing an extra pair of shoes if you complete the entire trail, may be muddy on heavy rain days\n-You are very close to a few gas stations and stores if you need any supplies</p><p>Park Hours: \nThe park is open year around from 8:00AM to Dusk </p>"
