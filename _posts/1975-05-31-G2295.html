sub_title: 'The only place on Hood where you can drive to the tree line and start your hike for quick views of glaciers.  '
overview: '<p>Begin from the small campground at Cloud Cap. Hike 200 feet south to the intersection of the Timberline Trail #600, then follow the pointer to Gnarl Ridge uphill to the left. Stay left on the trail, avoiding an intersection created by climbers who use a short cut to the glacier. The Timberline Trail climbs gradually to the southeast, passing a canyon with running water, before it reaches the junction with the Cooper Spur Trail after 1.2 miles.  Turn right and switch back up Cooper Spur, look for the old shelter shortly after turning on to cooper spur. I recommend taking a few min to check out the small shelter. Continue up cooper spur, stopping at Tie-In Rock where the trail ends and the climbing route begins. Here is a spectacular viewpoint at 8,500 feet. There you''ll find a view of the north side of Mt Hood and the Elliot Glacier (2nd largest in Oregon).</p><p>(Note: this track is just short of Tie-In rock) </p>'
tips: <p>Make sure to stop every so often once above the shelter and take a look behind you. On a clear day you can see Mt. St Helens AND Mt Adams. </p><p>Be sure to bring warm cloths even if its nice out because it gets cold as you get up near the glacier. Dont forget water and a snack its a ways down a bumpy dirt rd. back to town! </p><p>If you have time when you get back to the parking lot walk down to the old Cooper Spur Inn. Its no longer open to the public but its a neat place, and if your lucky a Crag Rat might be around and let you in or a tour! </p>
