What makes this trail great is its variation.  With a total length of 7.8 miles (out and back) it has a good amount of elevation gain and drop.  Plus four stream crossings - wear good footwear.  Due to trail damage on the upper section, Trail 100 is not a favorite of mountain bikers.  Further more, the lower section has steep elevation gains on either end, which further decreases the bike traffic. </p><p>&bull; It is a great trail for getting in hiking shape or to break in hiking gear - say your trying out a new pair of hiking boots.  It is also a great training trail, if you are getting in shape for say going up on Mt. Rainier, Mt. St. Helens (restricted in the number of people per day), or heading for a hiking vacation to the Colorado Rockies.  For training, add weight to your pack each time you hike, to build up endurance and altitude acclimation. </p><p>&bull; Mt. Spokane is a fee area, a Washington State Parks Discover Pass is required - $30 annual or $10 for single day use.  The State Parks no longer receive any of your tax dollars, their operations are financed by fees.  This includes just driving into the parks, for example to drive to the top of Mt. Spokane.  There is a $99 fine for not having a Discover Pass. </p><p>&bull; As all State and National Parks, this is a dog leashed only area.  There is a $75 fine for not having your dog leashed.  Be respectful to other users and for your own safety - there is wildlife on Mt. Spokane.  You probably don't want to know the fine and potential jail time penalties for you dog chasing wildlife - or having to deal with a mad moose. </p>
tips: '<p>If using the phone App: Go online for web links to maps &amp; resources and trail video. www.everytrail.com</p><p>&bull; This is a spiderweb trail, best to bring along a stick or trekking pole, if your one of the first out for the day.  </p><p>&bull; Wear liner socks, this trail can be hard on feet.  </p><p>&bull; I recommend trekking poles, assists on the uphills.</p><p>&bull; Watch out for lose rock in some sections.</p><p>&bull; Trail 100 is maintained in part by the Washington Trail Association (www.wta.org) and Inland Northwest Hikers (search at www.MeetUp.com) </p>'
