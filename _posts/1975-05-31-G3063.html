overview: <p>This short steep hike leaves the parking lot of Crater Lake Lodge and immediately heads uphill. Stick with it for a half mile or so and you will be rewarded with views of the lake - and they only get better as you climb! </p>
tips: <p>Bring water for the summer, it's REALLY hot and dusty up here. </p>
