description: <p>Third Fork Cabin is a former guard station, first established in 1906 as Station 10 and renamed Third Fork in 1908. A cabin was built at that time, which existed until the site was rebuilt by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1933. The current cabin&amp;#39;s exterior has changed little since that time, with the exception of a metal roof being added sometime before 1984.   The cabin is typically available between mid-April and late October, and it&amp;#39;s accessible by car. Many modern comforts are provided at the cabin, but guests may need to bring some additional supplies and gear for their stay.</p><p>   </p>
