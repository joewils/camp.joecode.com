sub_title: A nice hike into the Norse Peak Wilderness with fantastic views of several Cascade Volcanoes
overview: <p>This is a great alpine ridge walk just outside of Rainier National Park in the Norse Peak Wilderness.  This isn't a killer climb as there is minimal elevation change thus the views are attainable for the whole family.  The trail is easy to follow all the way to Noble Knob around Mutton Mountain which you can also run up if you'd like.  This trail is open to mountain bikers if you are interested... </p>
tips: |-
  <p>Directions to Trailhead:
  From the intersection with WA 167 and WA 410 drive 30 miles north on 410 to the Corral Pass forest service road.  Take this all the way up to the trailhead for trail #1184.  I don't believe there is a fee to park here. </p>
