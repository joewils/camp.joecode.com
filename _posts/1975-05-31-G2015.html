seo_title: ring-road-trail
sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.
overview: <p>This short trail is located in between the Wilderness Peak and Longview Peak. You will hike down a gentle trail through a ravine leading out of the Cougar Mountain Park. The trail is short but does offer some great views of open forested spaces. This trail can also be used by horseback riders; the trail is narrow in spots so use caution if you have to pass by a rider. This trail can also be a great way to warm up on. With most of the connecting trails containing a thick forest canopy, this can be a welcome sight to take a minute to warm up in the suns rays.</p><p>If you live nearby you can access this trail from the 182nd Ave cul-de-sac. Curbside parking is available if you are looking for a quick route up to the top of Wilderness Peak. However, I would not suggest curbside parking if you plan on horseback riding as the space is limited. </p>
