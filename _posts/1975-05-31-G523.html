sub_title: Tackle highest peak in Lassen Volcanic National Park and stand atop an active volcano.
overview: "<p>Located four hours north east of San Francisco this Northern California park might be a little out of the way, but it&rsquo;s a prime destination for seekers of tranquility and those with even just a passing interest in geology.</p><p>Mount Lassen is a towering testament to the volcanic origins of this region, and an imposing sight from the trailhead on the shores of Lake Helen. In truth however, hiking the two-and-a-half mile Lassen Peak trail which switchbacks its way gradually up the mountain can feel like a relatively gentle workout to many.</p><p>Elevation gain: \n&bull; 2,000ft (from 8,450 - 10,462ft)</p><p>Tips:\n&bull; The trail up the South face of the mountain is almost entirely without shade.  Pack the sunscreen and also bring layered clothing to protect you from the winds at higher altitudes.\n&bull; Where possible it's worth tackling Lassen Peak early in the day to beat the crowds and to avoid hiking up during the warmest part of the day.\n&bull; Summer through fall is the best time to experience this trail. Snow covers the Lassen landscape for much of the year, closing roads and obscuring trails. See our links below to National Park Service information on road and trail closures.\n&bull; Combine this hike with the 3-mile trek to Bumpass Hell for a great day out.\n </p>"
