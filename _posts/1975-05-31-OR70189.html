orientationDescription: <p>Umpqua National Forest visitors are often taken aback by unique and surprising landscapes shaped by explosive geologic events. The 984,602-acre forest provides spectacular scenery and an abundance of natural and cultural resources.</p><p> The translation of the word, &quot;umpqua,&quot; meaning &quot;thundering waters,&quot; defines the area. High mountain lakes, heart-stopping rapids, peaceful ponds and thundering waterfalls, including the 272-foot Watson Falls on the North Umpqua Highway, offer visitors a renewed sense of spirit.</p><p> Diverse ecosystems support a wide range of habitat for wildlife. From eagles and owls to salamanders and salmon, these species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests to live.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Hiking, biking, fishing and boating are popular summer and fall activities. In winter, visitors can take advantage of skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling opportunities.</p><p> Diamond Lake offers a scenic backdrop for swimmers braving its cold, refreshing waters, and anglers casting a lines from boat or shoreline. Rainbow trout thrive in the lake, as it is stocked annually with over 450,000 fingerlings. A boat ramp is on-site. The lake has a 10-mph speed limit.</p><p> Bicyclists enjoy riding on the 11 miles of paved trail around the lake, while hikers can head out for the day on one of many trails leaving from the area. Groups will enjoy throwing horseshoes, or playing a game of volleyball in courts near the pavilion.</p>
