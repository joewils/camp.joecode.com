The upper lake - just like Kalispell Island - cannot be access by car, so water is an excellent navigation option.</p>'

To access the Kalispell Bay Boat Launch, travel on Highway 57 for 31 miles to Kalispell Bay Road. Turn east (right) until you reach West Lakeshore Road.

Access is only by boat.</p>
