sub_title: 'Hike the core of a volcano!  An easy-moderate 1 mile walk up this 845ft tall remnant of a 57,000 year old eruption. '
overview: '<p>Beacon Rock is a the core of an ancient volcano.  Over thousands of years, hundreds of massive floods (originating in Missoula Montana) careened through the Columbia River Gorge and carved away the volcano''s main structure, leaving only the lava core we see today.  Depending on the definition and expert you talk to, it is the second largest free standing monolith in the northern hemisphere!</p><p>The trail up Beacon Rock is short and manageable for day-hikers of all ages, at just under a mile each direction.  It is well maintained, although not paved most the way.</p><p>BACKGROUND:  Beacon Rock is 848 feet (258 m) tall and is composed of Basalt. The United States Army Corps of Engineers planned to destroy the rock to supply material for the jetty at the mouth of the ColumbiaIn.  In 1915 Henry Biddle purchased the rock for $1 and over the next three years constructed the switchbacks and trail, most of which is still in use today.  After his death, Biddle''s family tried to make it a state park. At first Washington refused the gift, but changed its position when Oregon offered to accept. </p>'
tips: "<p>Expect wind at the base and top, but it is generally calm on the way up...so don't be fooled into over-dressing...the hike WILL warm you up!  Even on a moderate/cool day, shorts are preferable to pants.  (Take a look at those coming down the trail, and notice everyone has shed most their layers.)</p><p>There are no restrooms or water sources along the way, so be sure to utilize the facilities BEFORE heading up.</p><p>As with all WA State Parks, a daily or annual Discover Pass must be displayed by each vehicle. Daily passes are sold via an automated pay-station for $10. \nNOTE: Northwest Forrest Passes are NOT accepted! </p>"
