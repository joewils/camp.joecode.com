overview: <p>A short 2 to 4 mile hike into the waterfall. There are two locations to park off of HWY 35 so make sure not to leave valuables in the car. The parking location shown on the map is from the Polallie trail head. Park and cross hwy 35 to a steep unmarked trail on the west side. Follow this trail south. It will connect with the Tamanawas fall trail after crossing Cold Spring Creek. Otherwise for a shorter more family friendly hike park about two miles south.This is the normal Tamanawas Falls parking area. The falls itself is a large falls with a large dry cave behind the falls. Rocks can be very slippery when wet so make sure to watch your step. The dry cave makes for a great finish to the hike and a great place to eat your lunch. Fairly popular trail so if you plan on bringing a dog make sure to bring the leash as well for those people who are scared of dogs. </p>
tips: <p>This for the most part is a very easy hike in. simple dirt trail for the most part. Near the water fall there are large rocks which can be slippery from the mist of the falls. Regular hiking boots are recommended and of course some water. Pack in a lunch and eat at the falls. just remember if you pack it in make sure to pack it out. </p>
