sub_title: 'Descend into the dark volcanic underworld of the Subway Cave lava tube for a short yet highly memorable hike. '
overview: <p>Twenty thousand years ago and just 15 miles north of Lassen Volcanic National Park, the ground broke apart and huge volumes of volcanic rock poured forth to create the enormous expanse that is the Hat Creek Lava Flow.</p><p>Exposed to the air, the top of the lava flow began to cool and solidify, while molten rock below continued to flow - insulated by the now solid roof and creating lava tubes which carried the red-hot rock miles from its source.</p><p>Subway Cave is a section of lava tube less than a third of a mile long, located between two areas of ceiling cave-ins.  Substantial concrete steps have been constructed at both ends of the cave, providing easy access for all would-be spelunkers. </p>
tips: |-
  <p>&bull; Flashlights are a necessity in the cave. Forgetful folk may be able to rent them from the information center at Old Station, just south of the Subway Cave park.
  &bull; Take a jacket with you if you feel the cool conditions in the cave may be uncomfortable.
  &bull; Open from May to October due to winter weather restrictions.
  &bull; A very short return hike is also available which double-backs across the top of the tube to the entrance near the parking lot. </p>
