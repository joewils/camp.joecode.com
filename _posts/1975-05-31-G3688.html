sub_title: 'Take a ride or a walk around this beautiful city park which holds 3 different reservoirs for Portland '
overview: "<p>Although there is no swimming in the reservoirs for obvious reasons this park has plenty of other things to offer the whole family including picnic areas, a dog park, monuments and public art, and even volleyball and tennis areas.  I've drawn a quick path that will take you to views of all three reservoirs and to the top of Mt. Tabor but I also encourage you to check the link in this guide for a more detailed map and information about the park.  \n </p>"
