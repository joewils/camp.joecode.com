overview: <p>Start out at Lime Kiln Trail head, south east of Granite Falls, Washington.  Trail goes briefly through the forest to a mostly level road, before gently declining through the forest to follow the South Fork of the Stillaguamish river.  At one point you pass by Hubbard Lake and cross a bridge over Hubbard Creek.  Continue on the trail with peek-a boo views of the river.  Keep your eye out for relics left behind from the Everett- Monte Cristo railway.  Please leave relics as they are found for others to enjoy.  After descending a short hill the trail turns and follows the Stillaguamish along the original railroad grade.  Eventually you will come to the Lime Kiln located on the right side of the trail.  you can continue  almost a mile to where the remnant of the railroad bridge is located, at this point you can also take the loop which will drop you down to the river bank, or return to the trail head. For additional information on this trail and others nearby please visit http://www.robecanyon.org/ </p>
tips: <p>At some points on this trail it would be important to closely watch young children, as there are drop offs and a slippery log bridge.  If you take the river loop, and the water is low enough there is a nice beach to rest at. </p>
