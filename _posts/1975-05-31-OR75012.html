description: <p>The Indian Ridge Lookout sits at an elevation of 5,405 feet in the Willamette National Forest. Indian Ridge was named for the old Indian hunting trail that runs  along the summit.</p><p>Built in 1958, the lookout was used for firefighting by Forest Service personnel until 1973. The lookout is still staffed occasionally during emergencies.</p><p>The lookout is accessible by car, although the access road is rocky. Guests must be prepared to climb steep, narrow steps up the 30-foot tower to access the lookout&amp;#39;s cabin. The accommodations are primitive, so guests should be prepared to pack in most of their own supplies and gear.</p>

Follow to the top where the road ends at the lookout.  From Highway 58, turn at the Westfir junction, traveling north through Westfir (this road becomes FSR 19 or Aufderheide Scenic Byway) to FSR 1980.
