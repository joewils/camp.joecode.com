overview: <p>Steamboat Rock Hike - Poliganders Family Hikes is about 3.7 miles long and located near Osborne, Washington. The trail is great for hiking and normally takes 1-3 hours.</p><p>We camped near this park and decided to hike the infamous Steamboat Rock. (If you are looking for a place to camp in this area, I&nbsp;highly recommend camping at Steamboat Rock. Although we didn&rsquo;t camp here, we spent most of our time taking advantage of the amenities they have to offer.)Our first attempt&nbsp;to hike Steamboat was with a group that had kids aged from&nbsp;3 years to 13. The first part of the hike from the parking lot to the climb&nbsp;was a simple task for them, however, once we reached the point of incline we decided to turn back.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a section that requires some maneuvering and scaling of the mountain that we thought was a little too much for the younger crowd. I will note though, not all parents heeded the same caution. I saw kids as young or younger headed up the trail. Another thing that surprised me was the amount of people that hiked this trail without any water. (This trail looks to have its busy days, so if your hiking to get away from the crowds, the first part of this hike will not be pleasant, however once you get to the top, you can venture away from humans as needed.)Our second attempt was the&nbsp;next day. Leaving the younger crowd behind, this time I hiked it with myself and three kiddos aged 11-13. Pay close attention to the surrounding area when you hike from the parking lot to the Mountain, there are plenty of deer that like to hang out under the few trees that offer shade. We saw more that 6 mule deer just in that short hike. Also note that this hike is like walking on the beach. The first section of the trail is mostly sand.Once reaching the &quot;climb&quot; area, also pay close attention, although it looks like only one trail up, there is a trail almost directly next to the &quot;most traveled&quot; that offers a much easier access. We didn&rsquo;t notice this easier access until our descent. It was more obvious from this point of view. Once you reach the top, you have the option to take the trail to the left or the right. We opted for the right since we could tell that it was give us a great view. It did not disappoint. The pictures just do not give it justice. There are quite a few trails to follow depending on what area you want to see, if you want to do a longer hike, you can make a day of it. We opted for a short hike, vowing to hike it again soon to access&nbsp;areas we didn&rsquo;t explore yet.Remember you are in rattlesnake country. We did see one&nbsp;pretty good size snake on our hike. We heard a few others that we didn&rsquo;t wait around to see.&nbsp;Having lived in rattlesnake country for most of my life, they have a&nbsp;distinct sound that can't be mistaken.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you're done with the hike, don't forget to visit the ice cream shop and get a nice swirl cone. Perfect after a long hike! You can also purchase a shirt that states &quot;I climbed Steamboat Rock&quot;. At a price of $16.95, the kids loved them.Other hikes in the area are Lenore Caves and Northrup.

The durable rock was left behind through all of the Great Missoula Floods and was later nearly surrounded by the waters diverted by the Grand Coulee Dam. The top of the rock is a broad, flat plateau offering stunning views across the scablands of coulee country. </p>
tips: <p>-Rattlesnake warning-Water is a must !!- I wouldnt recommend this hike for the younger kiddos (3-7) unless you are sure they will stick near you and listen very well. -Discover Pass Needed-Dogs allowed on a leash - pack plenty of water.-Take advantage of the bathroom near the parking area - as you can see from the last photo on the hike, we all had to go! </p>
