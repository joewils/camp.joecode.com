orientationDescription: <p>The Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest offers rugged peaks, scenic rivers and interesting wildlife within the forest and surrounding designated wilderness areas.</p><p>On a clear day visitors will see Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, the active volcano is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.</p><p>Visitors will find unique ecosystems surrounding the campground. In the springtime, the towering old-growth forest shelters wildflowers such as western trillium, twinflower, foamflower, coralroot and twistedstalk.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The area is a prime location for hiking, boating, fishing, picnicking and horseback riding in summer and early fall. Visitors can also take advantage of skiing and snowshoeing in the winter months.</p><p>Baker Lake is a popular destination for boating, water skiing, canoeing, fishing and swimming. Anglers cast for kokanee, rainbow and cutthroat trout, salmon, native char and wild steelhead. The lake can be accessed from the campground.</p><p>Baker Lake Trail is an easy family hike that begins in a majestic stand of Douglas fir. In 1843, a small eruption of Mt. Baker caused a forest fire, and visitors can still see the burned snags of virgin cedar trees that once dominated the area. The trail contours above the eastern shoreline of Baker Lake.</p>
