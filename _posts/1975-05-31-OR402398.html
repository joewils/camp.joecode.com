description: <p>Bullards Beach is a large, family oriented park, located just two miles north of Bandon. The campground is nestled among shore pines and well protected from the strong ocean breezes. Besides three loops of campsites, the park boasts thirteen Yurts, making year-round camping a very popular choice. The horse camp features easy access to the beach and dunes for our equestrian campers. Well known for excellent fishing and crabbing opportunities on the Coquille River, our boat launch facilities stay packed during the summer and fall seasons.   Ocean beach access is 1 1/4 miles from the overnight campground by vehicle or paved pedestrian trail.</p><p>There&amp;#39;s more nearby. Across the river is Bandon by the Sea. Visit a variety of shops, galleries and restaurants in the town that is called &amp;quot;The Cranberry Capital of the West Coast&amp;quot;.   MAKE SURE YOUR SITE MEETS YOUR CAMPING NEEDS</p><p>Before reserving, please become familiar with the particulars of your chosen site, including the size of the tent pad area and the type of equipment that you may bring to the park.

importantInformation: '<p>During the winter Season (October - March) most campsites are removed from the reservation system. There are sites available to reserve plus more campsites will be available on a first come or drop in basis at Bullards Beach during that time period. Nightly camping rate includes one vehicle only. Extra vehicles will be charged $5.00 each per night upon arrival at park (changing to $7.00 per night May 1, 2014). Maximum of 2 allowed per site after payment of extra vehicle fees. 30 amp breakers in A Loop. 30 and 50 amp breakers in B Loop and C Loop. *Reservations for more than five nights/days that are later changed to fewer nights/days will be charged a fee equal to the nightly/daily site fee for each night/day canceled as well as the $8 transaction fee. Please be aware that only the person whose name is on the reservation may access, change or cancel the reservation. You can stay 14 consecutive nights in a single campground, and may return after spending at least three nights out of the park (it can be another state park campground; in fact, we recommend you DO select another state park campground). The maximum time allowed within any Oregon State Park is 14 nights within any 17 night period. Customers who wish to secure more than one site within a park for a continuous date period in order to accommodate their reservation request (i.e. split reservation), should be aware that the $8.00 reservation fee would apply to each site reserved. Reservation fee adjustments will not be made after reservations have been confirmed using the internet reservation service. If you are viewing inventory and find you are unable to secure one site to accommodate your request please consider calling the call center at 1-800-452-5687 to make your reservation. Discount programs which may be offered through the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department cannot be processed when making an internet reservation. For additional information on discount programs call the OPRD Information Center at 1-800-551-6949 or visit us online at www.OregonStateParks.org. Reservations can be made 24 hours a day, from 2 days to 9 months in advance. Campsite availability is based on call center hours, meaning sites become available when the call center opens. Call center hours are: Monday through Friday 8am to 5pm. </p>'
