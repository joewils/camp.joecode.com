orientationDescription: <p>Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest offers stunning scenic views, with high, glaciated alpine peaks, valleys of old growth forest and rugged shrub-steppe country making up the diverse landscape. Elevations range from below 1,000 feet to over 9,000 feet.</p><p>   More than 700 lakes and mountain ponds dot the glacier-carved terrain of nearby Alpine Lake Wilderness. Tree-covered valleys give</p><p>way to rocky ridges and rugged peaks along the crest of the Cascades. Many peaks and slopes are permanently cloaked in</p><p>snowfields. From wet forests of Douglas fir, cedar, and an understory of salal and berries, to firs and mountain hemlock, the</p><p>landscape opens up to expansive meadows matted with low growth and ends with dry forestland of ponderosa pine and</p><p>grasses.</p><p>  Congress designated the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in 1976 with a total of 362,789 acres. Prior to designation, aggressive mining</p><p>and logging operations punched numerous access roads into the area, creating a wildly irregular boundary to this popular area.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Eightmile Group Campground offers outdoor enthusiasts the opportunity to hike, fish, bike and enjoy a long list of outdoor</p><p>recreational activities throughout the year.  This campground has plenty of trails to explore by bike.</p><p> Anglers may want to cast a line into the deep pools at nearby Toketie Lake. Populations of rainbow and cutthroat trout find</p><p>habitat in this somewhat secluded lake.</p><p>The nearby Fourth of July Trail offers hikers expansive ridge line views and challenging terrain. Beginning in the</p><p>forest at 4,000 feet, the trail quickly climbs in elevation, out of the trees into more open, arid landscapes. The trail</p><p>continues, traversing through mountain meadows with spectacular views of the Stuart Mountain Range and Icicle Valley. At 10.6 miles, this is a solid day hike, though backpackers can hook up connecting trails to continue for multiple days though adjacent wilderness settings.</p>
