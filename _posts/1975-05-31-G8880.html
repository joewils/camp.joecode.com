sub_title: 'A popular sight seeing, camping, hiking, fishing, boating, and off road recreational area in eastern Oregon. '
overview: "<p>The towering rock structures of Succor Creek Canyon rise above prime riparian habitat and rock-hounding grounds.</p><p>Leslie Gulch is a strikingly beautiful vastness of volcanic tuff towers.  This is a picturesque place where wind, water, and time have created spectacular panoramas of unusually sculpted colorful conical towers, honeycombed pinnacles, and intricate multiple layered spires.</p><p>Succor Creek and Leslie Gulch provide opportunities for hiking, photography, camping, picnicking, wildlife viewing, bird watching, offroading, boating, and rock hounding.  Look for chukars or thundereggs.</p><p>Thundereggs which formed within holes in the volcanic ash may contain a variety of mineral deposits, some thundereggs contain agate.</p><p>Both campgrounds in the area are no fee and are first come, first served.\n  \nThe rugged canyons and rock formations of Leslie Gulch and Succor Creek are home to a population of California bighorn sheep.</p><p>Depending on the seasons precipitation, this area is usually open by the middle of April through November. The elevations in the area range from around 2600' in the canyons to about 4400' on the ridges.</p><p>Leslie Gulch is closed to horses to protect an endangered plant.</p><p>There is access to Lake Owyhee at the boat ramp at Leslie Gulch.</p><p>There are photographs and videos in this guide, but the scenery has to be seen to be really appreciated. This is a great area for a day long family outing. </p>"
tips: '<p>Northern access to the area starts at Adrian, Oregon or Homedale, Idaho. Southern access starts at Jordan Valley, Oregon.</p><p>The roads are recommended for high clearance vehicles, but I have seen many automobiles on the southern route into the area. All vehicles are restricted to designated roads/trails.</p><p>There is no potable water in the area. It is a primitive area, so bring everything you may need with you and pack it out when you leave.</p><p>There are no mapped hiking trails, but many impromptu trails lead to interesting rock formations and viewpoints. Most of the secondary roads in the area are more suited for hiking than driving.</p><p>Be prepared for ticks and be on the lookout for rattlesnakes. The weather is unpredictable and you may encounter extreme conditions. DON''T GO WHEN IT IS WET! The mud can be unbelievable.</p><p>There is no cell phone service in the area.</p><p>For further info contact the BLM at Vale, Oregon, telephone # (541) 473-3144 or at www.or.blm.gov/Vale. </p>'
