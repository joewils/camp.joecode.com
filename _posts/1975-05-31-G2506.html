title: Deschutes River Trail (Aspen to Big Eddy)
seo_title: deschutes-river-trail-aspen-to-big-eddy
sub_title: Fly-fishing and mountain biking, side by side for miles and miles...
overview: <p>Like all the other sections of the Deschutes River Trail, the mile or so from Aspen to Big Eddy are a mix of willow flats, raging rapids, slow meanders, and higher ridges. It's a great little out and back hike, but for the full effect, team it up with the sections upstream or downstream for a longer hike. </p>
tips: <p>Don't forget your binoculars, there are a lot of animals out along this section but they're easily spooked if you get too close. </p>
