sub_title: 'Remote alpine lakes and a spectacular mountain summit, perfect for a long day hike or backpacking adventure. '
overview: |-
  <p>Mount Eddy might be the highest peak in the Klamath Mountains but barely anyone notices since it's overshadowed by the gargantuan Mount Shasta, a staggering five thousand feet taller. </p><p>Overshadowed though it may be, the scenery, solitude and variety of the wilderness around Mount Eddy and Dead Fall Lakes should not be overlooked.</p><p>The lakes lie in a bowl almost entirely ringed by mountain peaks, which is where the first half of this hike takes us. The lakes are reason enough to put on your hiking boots even if you don't plan on a Mount Eddy summit, and are a great destination for backpackers.</p><p>Elevation gain:
  &bull; 2,225ft (from 6,800 - 9,025ft) </p>
tips: |-
  <p>&bull; Early June through October is usually the best time to attempt this hike, subject to the severity depending on the severity of recent weather.
  &bull; Bug spray is highly recommended around the lakes in early summer.
  &bull; Be aware that this hike is in a remote location, and it is inadvisable to driving up to this location in winter conditions due to the risks of becoming stranded. </p>
