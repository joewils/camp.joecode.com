Or visit the McFadden Marsh observation blind to view numerous migratory waterfowl in the winter.</p><p>A great way to visit the refuge and see various types of wildlife during the winter months is by driving along the Auto Tour Route . This road winds through the middle of the Refuge taking you past wetlands, creeks and ponds that migratory birds call home in the winter. Follow the road to the south end of the refuge to see hundreds of birds on McFadden Marsh, geese feeding on the fields and Pigeon Butte</p><p>Fishing is allowed from May 1 through October 31 in designated areas.

tips: <p>To reach the William L. Finley National Wildlife Refuge, travel south 10 miles from Corvallis or north 7.5 miles from Monroe, to milepost 93 on Highway 99W. Turn west on Finley Road. </p><p>Dawn and dusk are the best times to see wildlife. In warmer climates, little is moving on hot summer afternoons or windy days. </p><p>Cars make good observation blinds. Drive slowly, stopping to scan places wildlife might hide. Use binoculars or a long lens for a closer look. </p><p>Try sitting quietly in one good location. Let wildlife get used to your presence. Many animals that have hidden will reappear once they think you are gone. Often you will hear more than you will see. </p>
