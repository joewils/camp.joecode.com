sub_title: Via Northeast Ridge with optional ski descent
overview: <p>This is a fun ascent and ski descent of a nice peak with good skiing options.   From the trailhead head out on logging road 350.  Keep an eye on the gps track to figure out where best to head into the woods.  This is your choice but the track does follow an easy route through the trees for those with skis on.  You may be able to find a snowmobile track to follow higher up on the ridgeline.  Follow the ridge all the way to the summit.  From the summit you have a bunch of ski options.  You can tackle the steep face back down to the bowl below or traverse back along the ridge for a safer route through the trees.  We did the latter as the snow conditions didn't seem to safe.  If all is good I would suggest skiing down the bowl then traversing skiers right to re-join the ridge for the descent. </p>
tips: <p>From Highway 140 near the north end of Klamath Lake take a left onto West Side Road and continue down the road to the Malone Spring Trailhead.  I don't belive a Northwest Forest Pass is required here but it may be so be aware. </p>
