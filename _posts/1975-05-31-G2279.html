title: June Lake to Loowit Falls
seo_title: june-lake-to-loowit-falls
sub_title: Tour of Mt. St. Helens
overview: <p>A beautiful hike showing many faces of St. Helens. The turn-around point has good views of Spirit Lake and the crater on Helens. There are a few difficult gorge crossings on the way to Ape Canyon at the beginning where the trail is not in the best shape. Often June Lake will be in the clouds but you will emerge in to the sun on the higher and drier east side of the mountain. </p>
tips: <p>Camping at June Lake the night before is suggested to get an early start on what is a long day. Dogs are allowed in the first part of the hike but not once you're around on the north side in the special research area. </p>
