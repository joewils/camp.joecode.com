overview: '<p>This hike is listed as easy and can be done with children.  You hike through a Douglas fir forest with some interesting rock formations as well. From the top you can see the McKenzie River Valley as well as the Three Sisters.</p><p>UPDATED:  I''ve now added the King Castle Trail to this hike.  It is much longer and starts just outside of the town of Rainbow at POI #5.</p><p>The King Castle Trail is a lot of fun to ride down.  You can pay for a shuttle ride from the nearby McKenzie Mountain Resort, or take two cars parking one at POI #1 and the other at POI #5. </p>'
