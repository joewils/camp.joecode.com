importantInformation: <p> In accordance with standard industry practices, Mount Hood Recreation will be assessing a $8 additional vehicle fee on the &apos;second vehicle&apos; in each single family campsite, and on the &apos;third and fourth vehicle&apos; in any double family campsite, provided these vehicles are not joined to the first vehicle by a hitch and towed onto the site. In the case of motorcycles, the first two are considered as one vehicle for determining additional vehicle fees. The third and fourth motorcycle would also be considered as one vehicle. No additional vehicle fees are collected for bicycles. Utility hookups are not available Off-road vehicle use is prohibited within the campground Click here for more information on the Mount Hood National Forest The campground is managed by Mt. Hood Recreation, doing business as California Land Management. Comment forms and more information are available from campground hosts or on our website . Due to the spread of invasive insects, firewood from outside the area is not permitted. Help protect our forests by purchasing or collecting firewood at or near your camping destination and burning it on-site. Click here for more information.</p>
nearbyAttrctionDescription: <p>The picturesque, blue-green Surprise Lake is located not far from the campground, up a steep climb. It is most popular for fishing, as the lake isn&amp;#39;t large enough for motorized boats.</p><p>The Bagby Hot Springs are located about 20 miles southwest of the campground. A popular site for soaking and relaxation, the springs are in a heavily wooded forest in the scenic Cascade Mountains of Oregon. A historic guard station was built there in 1913 and the available bathhouses are fed by three major hot water springs and several minor outlets in the area.</p>
note: ''
orientationDescription: <p>The campground is situated at an elevation of 1,249 feet, in Oregon&amp;#39;s Cascade Mountains, nestled in a mixed forest of conifers and hardwoods, including grand old Douglas firs and a variety of evergreens. A thick gathering of ferns and ivy increase privacy between campsites. Some sites overlook the river and others neighbor a mountain creek.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The family-friendly Clackamas River Trail is popular for hiking and mountain biking and begins at the upper end of the campground. It extends about 8 miles and climbs about 450 feet in elevation along the way. It is available year-round, but may be covered in snow during winter months. The Indian Henry Trail, which trolls through the forest, is also located near the campground.</p><p>Fishing is very popular in the nearby river and anglers can expect a catch of winter steelhead, spring chinook and late summer kokanee salmon, as well as other species of freshwater fish. Whitewater rafting is also enjoyed by visitors to the area. The Clackamas River provides miles of wild water as it bends through the scenic Cascade range.</p>
