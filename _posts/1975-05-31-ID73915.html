At the time, the Forest Service used a cabin already on-site as a guard station and then built a new one in 1927. The current cabin and outbuildings were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935, and the cabin today looks much as it did back then.</p><p>Guests can drive to Barber Flat Cabin in two-wheel drive passenger cars or trucks, although the roads may occasionally be rough.
