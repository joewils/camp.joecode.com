orientationDescription: <p>This historically significant, two-story cabin was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1933 to house workers. It is a classic example of the Forest Service rustic architectural style of Depression Era administration buildings. Across the road is the old District Ranger&amp;#39;s office, which is now a two-room visitor center.</p><p>The cabin is located a quarter-mile from the small, 3-acre Clackamas Lake and just 3 miles from the larger Timothy Lake, at an elevation of 3,400 feet. It is surrounded by tall trees and is part of a 4-acre compound and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Clackamas Lake is a great place for fishing, swimming and non-motorized boating. Anglers can expect a catch of cutthroat, brook, rainbow and some German brown trout. A variety of wildlife make its home in the area as well. Nearby, the 1,400-acre Timothy Lake provides opportunities for picnicking as well as water-related recreation, including the use of power boats.</p><p>Hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding are also enjoyed by visitors to the area. The 2.2-mile Miller Trail begins in the neighboring campground and connects trekkers to the lengthy but scenic Pacific Crest Trail, which extends more than 2,650 miles, from Canada to Mexico. Additional trails, to scenic Little Crater Lake and to the Mt. Jefferson Wilderness area, are also available in the area. A Northwest Forest Pass or Mount Hood Recreation day use fees are in effect at nearby trails and sites.</p>
