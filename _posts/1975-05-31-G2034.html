sub_title: Twenty-five miles of spectacular backpacking in the Absaroka Beartooth Wilderness of Montana, USA.
overview: <p>&quot;The Beaten Path&quot; is a 25 mile trail traversing some of the most spectacular country within the 944,000 acre Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness.  Lakes and streams appear around just about every corner enticing both those appreciative of a spectacular Wilderness view or one with a penchant for hooking a trout upon the end of their fly-line.  </p><p>The trail itself is aptly-titled &quot;The Beaten Path&quot; for it is literally a well-worn treadway stretching from Cooke City in the South to East Rosebud in the North.  Signage is ample and the route is easy-to-follow during the summer season (July - early September).  For the more adventurous, ample opportunities to leave the trail and find true Wilderness lie up every draw you see.  </p><p>The Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness is part of the greater Yellowstone ecosystem and spans 944,000 acres of Montana and Wyoming. The two access points to &quot;The Beaten Path&quot; are at East Rosebud Trailhead (about 15 miles from Roscoe, Montana) and the Clark Fork Trailhead (a couple miles East of Cooke City, Montana).  You'll find primitive car camping options at both ends of the trail so arriving in the evening and car camping before an early departure into the backcountry is an option.  </p><p>The trail rises in elevation to a high point and then descends so hiking North from Cooke City or South from Ease Rosebud are both options.  Viewing the elevation profile will provide you a better understanding and will help you decide which direction is best for you.  The trail is approximately 25 miles long and passes through a number of ecosystems.  Although it has been hiked in a single day many times the beauty of the scenery and possibility for off-trail exploration may cause you to opt to spend a few days along the path.  Consider shorter days and spend the extra time fishing or bagging a peak. </p>
tips: <p>Considerations should be made when planning your hike regarding a few points.  The trail passes through high elevation alpine terrain which holds snow into the month of July which can make the terrain difficult to pass for some hikers.  The elevation will also cause people from lower elevations to be out of breath.  If either of these considerations concern you be certain to plan your itinerary accordingly.  The Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness is located in grizzly bear country and special planning must be undertaken to avoid conflicts with bears and well as to provide safety to yourself and the wildlife. </p>
