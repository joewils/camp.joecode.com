seo_title: wilderness-peak-trail
sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.
overview: <p>This is the highest point within the Cougar Mountain Park. To get here you can take either the Wilderness Creek Trail or the Wilderness Cliffs Trail. The hike up to this point can be a challenge where you will encounter a steep climb and at times, rocky terrain. The final stretch to the peak is a gentle short climb where you can rest and relax. </p><p>On your way up towards the peak you will be surrounded by giant ferns. The trail is shady, provided by the large Douglas fir trees over head. After your short hike down this trail you will come to a small clearing and a large wooden bench. The peak on this mountain does not afford you a view as the top is covered in a dense forest. Take a seat on the giant wooden chair and relax, reflect on your accomplishment of making it to the peak. Before heading back down the mountain take a minute to sign the log book located across from the wooden chair, showing that you made it to the top. </p>
