note: ''
orientationDescription: <p>Fort Spokane lies on the water amidst Ponderosa pines and shrubs. It is near the confluence of the Spokane River and the Columbia River (Lake Roosevelt). The lake has comfortable temperatures during summer, even though much of the water originates from glaciers and snow in the cold, high Canadian Rockies. The lake area is abundant with wildlife, including moose, elk, deer, bighorn sheep, birds and fish.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Fort Spokane boasts some of the best bird habitats in the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area. The prime viewing spot is Hawk Creek, only a few miles away. Birders often see Peregrine falcons, Blue herons, finches, Bald eagles, osprey and even the occasional Golden eagle.</p><p>The former guard house of the fort is still standing and has been converted to a visitor center and museum directly across the street from the campground. The center is open from June through Labor Day, teaching visitors about the military history and Indian boarding school through interpretive programs and exhibits. An interpretive trail around the grounds is open year round, for a more self-guided tour.</p><p>The lake is abundant with walleye, bass, rainbow trout and salmon, making it a popular place for fishing throughout the year; the shoreline along Fort Spokane does not typically freeze in winter and the campground&amp;#39;s boat-launch is open all year.</p>
