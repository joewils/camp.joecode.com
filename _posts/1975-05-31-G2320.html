sub_title: 'Start at the Montana/Idaho border and explore 10 tunnels, 7 trestles and 15 miles of Idaho history, scenery and wildlife '
overview: |-
  <p>Begin your odyssey in Montana and immediately plunge deep underground to surface in Idaho where you'll stay for the rest of your historic wanderings.
  The Route of the Hiawatha may very well be the pride of America when it comes to trails. Descriptions can be exaggerated, but the sheer numbers can't lie. The trail is studded with ten tunnels (The longest is 8771 feet long.), seven trestles (The highest is 850 feet long and 230 feet high.), dozens of educational signs, thousands of trees and animals, hundreds of... Well, hopefully you get the picture.
  And while numbers don't lie, they also can't come close to describing the beauty and grandeur of this Idaho classic. A true trail fanatic could ride the Route of the Hiawatha and its nearby cousin, the Trail of the Couer d' Alenes and be in trail heaven.
  To access this trail, find Interstate 90, then turn off at either exit 61 if approaching from the Idaho side or exit 5 if approaching from the Montana side. It is a good idea to visit the website links provided with this guide for information about the trail fee, shuttle service, and bike rentals.
  Follow the path of the Milwaukee Road and enjoy a perfect path to paradise on the Route of the Hiawatha. </p>
tips: |-
  <p>- There is a fee for using the trail, but it is well worth the modest price. It is $8 for adults &amp; $4 for children ages 3-13.
  - If you only want to ride the trail downhill, you can pay $9 for a shuttle bus ride to the top.
  - You absolutely want to take a light with you. Handlebar mounted lights are best and helmet/head mounted lights work almost as well. You also want to consider bringing a rear light, if possible. A couple of the tunnels are very long and dark and none of the tunnels have lighting. Lights are available for rent/loan at some of the local bike rental businesses.
  - Definitely dress in layers. It can get quite warm on the trail yet be surprisingly cold and breezy in the tunnels.
  - Write ahead &amp; have a brochure sent to you so you can get current shuttle hours, trail fees, rental information, etc. Follow the link in the right margin of this guide to find the Hiawatha Trail websites. </p>
