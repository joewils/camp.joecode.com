sub_title: Follow Field Mouse on a quick educational hike located on Squak Mountain.
overview: <p>This is a great hike for you to take the kids on. The trail is short and has almost no elevation change to it. It also provides a little education on how the forest and its animals work together to form an ecosystem.</p><p>You will follow Field Mouse, who is the lead character, while he takes his first hike into the forest. Along the way he will encounter several of the forest inhabitants who educate him on their jobs in the forest. As you follow along on his journey you will meet a crow, bugs, tree frog, woodpecker, beaver, and a squirrel. Each one of them will explain their role in the forest.</p><p>The story of Field Mouse would make a great short story for young kids at home as well. Included in the photos, I copied the information from the stories down. With this guide you will be able to read the story of Field Mouse and his journey any time you wish. </p>
