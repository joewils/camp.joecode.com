importantInformation: '<p>*Reservations for more than five nights/days that are later changed to fewer nights/days will be charged a fee equal to the nightly/daily site fee for each night/day canceled as well as the $8 transaction fee. Reservations can be made 24 hours a day, from 2 days to 9 months in advance. Campsite availability is based on call center hours, meaning sites become available when the call center opens giving no preference toonline users versus phone-in customers. Call center hours are: Monday through Friday 8am to 5pm. Please be aware that only the person whose name is on the reservation may access, change or cancel the reservation. You can stay 14 consecutive days in a single campground, and may return after spending at least three days out of the park (it can be another state park campground; in fact, we recommend you DO select another state park campground). The maximum time allowed within any Oregon State Park is 14 days within any 17 day period. Discount programs which may be offered through the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department cannot be processed when making an internet reservation. For additional information on discount programs call the OPRD Information Center at 1-800-551-6949 or visit us online at www.OregonStateParks.org. Customers who wish to secure more than one site within a park for a continuous date period in order to accommodate their reservation request (i.e. split reservation), should be aware that the $8.00 reservation feewould apply to each site reserved. Again, fee adjustments will not be made after reservations have been confirmed using the internet reservation service. If you are viewing inventory and find you are unable tosecure one site to accommodate your request please consider calling the call center at 1-800-452-5687 to make your reservation. MAKE SURE YOUR SITE MEETS YOUR CAMPING NEEDS Before reserving, please become familiar with the particulars of your chosen site, including the size of the tent pad area and the type of equipment that you may bring to the park. Site details and tent pad sizescan be viewed online by clicking on the site name. A Large campsite has at least a 12&apos;x12&apos; tent pad area. Medium sites are at least 10&apos;x10&apos; and Small sites are at least 8&apos;x8&apos;. </p>'
