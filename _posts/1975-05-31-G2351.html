sub_title: An amazing gorge hike with several beautiful waterfalls including one you can walk behind!
overview: <p>This is a beautiful gorge hike not far from Portland.  It takes you on trails that hug cliffs (hope you don't have a fear of heights) and past numerous beautiful waterfalls.   I hiked this trail on a rainy weekend in the spring so water levels were high (high enough for kayakers to run the canyon beneath us).  I suggest doing this hike in the spring or early summer as well to really appreciate the beautiful waterfalls. </p>
tips: <p>From Portland take exit 41 off of I-84 and take a right at the end of the ramp.  Drive 0.5 miles to the end of the road.  A Northwest Forest Pass is required to park here for the day.  Be careful to lock your car as there have been reports of break-ins here.</p><p>The GPS track in this guide does not extend all the way to Twister Falls because the GPS lost signal in the steep canyon walls.  Be aware that this will happen with yours too but there is only one clear trail and as long as you stick by (and above the river) there is no way you'll get lost! :) </p>
