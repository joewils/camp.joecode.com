Discount programs which may be offered through the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department cannot be processed when making an internet reservation. For additional information on discount programs call the OPRD Information Center at 1-800-551-6949 or visit us online at www.OregonStateParks.org. Reservations can be made 24 hours a day, from 2 days to 9 months in advance. Campsite availability is based on call center hours, meaning sites become available when the call center opens.
