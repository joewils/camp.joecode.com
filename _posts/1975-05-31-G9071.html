overview: <p>This is a great day trip for a family.</p><p>Jordan Craters is a 27 square-mile olivine basalt lava flow that is estimated to be between 4,000 and 9,000 years old. They estimated the age by the degree of lichen growth on the rocks. There is also an 18- acre flow within the field that is estimated to be less than 100 years old. </p><p>There is one area of Jordan Craters that has vehicle access and this is Coffee Pot Crater. This crater is about two-thirds of a square mile and its considered to be a well-preserved, steep-sided crater.</p><p>The Birch Creek Ranch name encompasses two different ranches, Birch Creek Ranch and Morrison Ranch. Between the two ranches there is a total of 26 buildings or structures that are watched over by a caretaker and his wife. Some of these buildings helped this property be placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. </p><p>Birch Creek Historic Ranch serves as the primary take-out for floaters on the lower section (downstream of Rome, Oregon) of the Owyhee Wild and Scenic River. </p><p>Camping, fishing, photography, geocaching, and wildlife viewing are all pleasurable pastimes in this historic setting. There are several stock trails, suitable for hiking, leading to the canyon rim.</p><p>A five-unit campground with fire rings and picnic tables is located along the river. There is no potable water and no fee. </p>
