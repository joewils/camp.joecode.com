note: ''
orientationDescription: <p>Hemmed in by several designated wilderness areas, Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest showcases rugged peaks, sparkling alpine   lakes and old-growth forests.</p><p>On a clear day visitors will see Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area. Rising to an elevation   of 10,781 feet, the active volcano from which the forest takes its name is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive   network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive   volcanic crater.   Wildlife in the area include mountain goats, coyotes, pine marten and a variety of migratory birds and native fish.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>In addition to being a prime location for hiking, fishing, horseback riding and picnicking in summer and early fall, Middle Fork offers excellent skiing and snowshoeing in the winter months.</p><p> Approximately 1,500 miles of trails throughout the area can entice any hiker to get outdoors. From smooth paths meandering   through deep quiet forests to challenging ascents up boulder-studded mountains, opportunities abound for every skill   level.</p><p>The popular Middle Fork Trail is a 3 mile trail offering visitors a glimpse into the area&amp;#39;s diversity. The trail begins by   crossing the Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie River via the Gateway Bridge, then turns upstream and meanders   between the river and overhanging cliffs, offering sweeping views of nearby peaks. After climbing away from the river and passing   under Stegosaurus Butte, a granite ridge towering over the valley at over 1,000 feet, the trail follows an old logging railroad   grade used by pioneers and finally descends back to river level.</p><p>The Middle Fork Snoqualmie Trail is also used by bicycles and horseback riders. Mountain bikes are allowed on the trail on odd-  numbered days of the week.</p><p> A Recreation Pass is required for each vehicle parked at the trailhead.</p>
