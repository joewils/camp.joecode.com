overview: <p>This is a long and muddy hike, but the huge tree waiting at the end has been there for nearly 2000 years - so be patient and endure. </p><p>The Boy Scout Tree is one of the largest marked trees in the park and the easiest to find.

tips: <p>Watch out for the spring mud and take lots of snacks, you're going to be on the trail for a long time.  </p>
