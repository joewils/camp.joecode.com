orientationDescription: <p>On a clear day visitors can spot Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, this active volcano is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.</p><p>Along the banks of the Sauk River an outstanding show of wildflowers in July and August includes paintbrush, phlox, tiger lilies, aster, columbine and lupine. During the summer salmon and steelhead appear in abundance as they head up the river to spawn.</p><p>  The surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests support an abundance of wildlife. In addition to being home to a multitude of mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles, the area sustains more rare species such as lynx, moose, wolves and wolverine.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest boasts 1,500 miles of trails. From smooth paths meandering through deep quiet forests to challenging ascents up boulder-studded mountains, opportunities abound for every skill level. Access to biking, rafting and fishing is also readily available.</p><p>The nearby Frog Lake Trail is a short nature hike, climbing steadily up the side of the hill, with views of Clear Creek far below. The trail comes out at the road after nearly a mile, then makes a sharp turn back toward the lake, passing through dense forest, and eventually ending at the 1.5-acre Frog Lake.</p><p>Old Sauk Trail winds along the banks of the Sauk River, providing a pleasant hike amongst the wildlife and waterfowl that frequent the area.</p>
