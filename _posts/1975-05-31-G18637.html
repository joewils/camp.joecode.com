sub_title: Loop trail passes by two waterfalls on the McKenzie River
overview: <p>Sahalie Falls and Koosah Falls are located on the old &quot;Clear Lake Cutoff&quot; section of Highway 126. These falls mark the terminus of two thick flows of basaltic andesite lava that dammed Clear Lake and moved into the McKenzie River 3,000 years ago. The results are two breathtaking waterfalls with foaming white water cascades in between. </p><p>Sahalie (or &quot;Heaven&quot;) and Koosah (or &quot;Sky&quot;) are Chinook Jargon words - part of a rudimentary trade language that allowed people to exchange news and goods in the area. The Kalapuya, Molalla, Sahaptain and Chinook peoples traveled and traded here, perhaps on their way to obtain obsidian in the high Cascades or to gather huckleberries.</p><p>A loop trail connects the two waterfalls, and the McKenzie River National Recreation Trail, and offers up close views of the wild McKenzie River.</p><p>Both sites feature parking area, interpretive panels that tell the story of area geology, restrooms and observation points.</p><p>Sahalie Falls Viewpoint is fully accessible. </p>
