seo_title: humbug-mountain-highest-mountain-on-the-oregon-coast
sub_title: Take a hike up the highest mountain directly on the Oregon Coast.
overview: <p>This is a nice loop hike for some exercise on the wet Oregon Coast.  You will hike through a mostly Douglas Fir forest on the way up the coasts highest mountain which can be seen from miles away north and south.  Unfortunately the top is a little overgrown so you will not have a spectacular view but there is a bench to sit down on for a rest. </p>
tips: <p>Look for signs for a parking area and trailhead about 4.5 miles south of the town of Port Orford on Highway 101.  You will want a Northwest Forest Pass for parking here I believe. </p>
