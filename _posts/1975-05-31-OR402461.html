importantInformation: '<p> Due to paving maintenance project, the park will be closed 9/30/14 through 10/31/14. During construction the Jasper Point campground at Prineville Reservoir will remain open for walk-in camping, with 27 electric and water hookup campsites (RV dump station available). The campground is located 2.5 miles east of the main campground There is a 6 person maximum allowed for any campsite at Prineville. Pets must be under control on a maximum 6&apos; leash and waste properly allowed removed. Do not leave pets unattended. Your vehicle must fit in the allowed driveway. Only 2 vehicles are allowed in most sites, some sites 1 vehicle only. A $5 fee per night is assessed for a second vehicle at a campsite (changing to $7.00 per night May 1, 2014). If you reserve a cabin, please look for your access combination in the Security Alerts section of your confirmation letter. Seasonal closures: A Loop will be closed from Sept. 30, 2012 through April 30, 2013. B and most of C Loops do not have water hookups from October 15 through April 15. For this reason these sites are discounted an additional $6 off of the normal Discovery Season rate. Sites C7, C8, C9, C11, C13, C14 and C21 are the only sites with water hook ups from October 15 through April 15. Electricity and sewer hookups are not turned off in Discovery season. *Reservations for more than five nights/days that are later changed to fewer nights/days will be charged a fee equal to the nightly/daily site fee for each night/day canceled as well as the $8 transaction fee. Please be aware that only the person whose name is on the reservation may access, change or cancel the reservation. You can stay 14 consecutive nights in a single campground, and may return after spending at least three nights out of the park (it can be another state park campground; in fact, we recommend you DO select another state park campground). The maximum time allowed within any Oregon State Park is 14 nights within any 17 night period. Customers who wish to secure more than one site within a park for a continuous date period in order to accommodate their reservation request (i.e. split reservation), should be aware that the $8.00 reservation fee would apply to each site reserved. Reservation fee adjustments will not be made after reservations have been confirmed using the internet reservation service. If you are viewing inventory and find you are unable to secure one site to accommodate your request please consider calling the call center at 1-800-452-5687 to make your reservation. Discount programs which may be offered through the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department cannot be processed when making an internet reservation. For additional information on discount programs call the OPRD Information Center at 1-800-551-6949 or visit us online at www.OregonStateParks.org. Reservations can be made 24 hours a day, from 2 days to 9 months in advance. Campsite availability is based on call center hours, meaning sites become available when the call center opens. Call center hours are: Monday through Friday 8am to 5pm. </p>'
