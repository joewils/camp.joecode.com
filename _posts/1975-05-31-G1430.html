sub_title: Three day climb via Camp Muir, Ingraham Glacier &amp; Disappointment Cleaver
overview: '<p>This is one of the standard routes up Mt. Rainier.  You will ascent the Muir Glacier to Camp Muir and spend the 1st night there.  Then you will continue on to the Ingraham Glacier campsite which is just another 1,000 feet above Muir.  There you will spend one more short night to acclimatize before leaving camp around 2am in the morning for an early summit bid.  You will ascend Dissapointment Cleaver and hopefully make the summit near or just after sunrise.  Return via the same track 9,000 feet after packing up camp in one day.  You will be tired!</p><p>Note: Before attempting this climb you MUST have experience in glacier and high alpine travel and crevasse rescue.  Please check and read the supplemental links with this guide before you go.  Use this guide as a directional track but do a A LOT OF READING about this mountain before attempting it.  There are many guide services you can contact as well if you do not have experience. </p>'
