seo_title: eagle-creek-pct
sub_title: Waterfalls and beautiful gorge scenery along an easy trail.
overview: <p>This is an easy &quot;out and back&quot; hike with great scenery of waterfalls, ferns, and rocky outcroppings.  It's quite popular with easy vehicle access at the trailhead, so plan to see alot of other hikers and is part of the Pacific Crest Trail - this is not the trail for you if you're looking for solitude. </p>
tips: <p>Bring your raincoat.  Watch your step as you're hiking, the rocks on the trail are slippery and losing your footing or stumbling is not a good idea on a narrow trail with a long drop to the creek bed.  GPS occasionally will lose signal in the walls of the gorge. </p>
