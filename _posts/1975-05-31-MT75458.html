description: <p>Eagle Guard Station is located in high grasslands and surrounded by a scattered forest in the Elkhorn Mountains in west-central Montana.</p><p>The former Eagle Creek Ranger Station was built by miner Richard Owen in 1895. While his family lived there, the area was in a booming gold rush. In  1908, the cabin was taken over by the Forest Service for administrative use. It is the oldest administrative log structure on the Helena National Forest, predating the  establishment of the Forest.</p><p>Today the cabin is a rustic retreat for guests seeking relaxation and recreation. The cabin is accessible by car, but the last 4 miles are  only open to foot, horseback and cross-country ski traffic from December 2nd through May 15th. Several amenities are provided, but guests should be prepared to pack in some of their own supplies and gear.</p>
drivingDirection: '<p>All mileage is approximate from the highway.  From Helena, take Highway 287 for 26 miles southeast towards Townsend, Montana. Turn right on Indian Creek Road just before crossing the Missouri River. Travel for 3 miles, then turn left onto Forest Road #4031 (purple sign). Travel 5 miles to an intersection and stay to the right. This road will lead down a hill, into a narrow canyon and under a conveyor belt for the current mining operations in that area. Stay to the left, but continue on Forest Road #4031 for another 2.5 miles. Turn right and travel 0.5 miles to the cabin.</p><p>From December 2 through May 15, the last 4 miles are not open to motorized vehicles. Access to the cabin is by foot, ski, or horseback.</p>'
