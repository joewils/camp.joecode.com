overview: "<p>Located four hours north east of San Francisco this Northern California park might be a little out of the way, but it&rsquo;s a prime destination for seekers of tranquility and those with even just a passing interest in geology.</p><p>Many folk head to Lassen Volcanic National Park with a plan to hike Lassen Peak, and for good reason - it's a really good signature hike for the park.</p><p>However, if you have time to hike only one peak on your travels here, then you might prefer to choose Brokeoff Mountain which we think is a better hike, but also affords you some of the best views of the park from the summit, including great ones of Lassen Peak.</p><p>Elevation gain: \n&bull; 2,600ft (from 6,600 - 9,235ft)</p><p>Tips:\n&bull; Summer through fall is the best time to experience this trail. Snow covers the Lassen landscape for much of the year, closing roads and obscuring trails. See our links below to National Park Service information on road and trail closures.\n </p>"
