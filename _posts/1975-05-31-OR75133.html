description: <p>Caretaker&amp;#39;s Cabin allows guests to relax in the outdoors and step back in time to when the cabin was used during bygone gold mining days. It is part of the Fremont Powerhouse complex, a hub for mining built in the early 1900s. One of four cabins located at the site, this cabin offers flexibility for large groups. Guests can rent all four cabins and also pitch tents in the grassy yard.</p><p>The surrounding valleys once teemed with mining activity, primarily gold. The Fremont Powerhouse was built in 1908 as an economical method for mining. Two dams were constructed at Olive Lake, and water from the lake was piped through an 8-mile wood and steel pipeline to the powerhouse to generate electricity. Homes were constructed to shelter workers who monitored the pipeline. Today, these same shelters are available for recreational rentals.</p><p>The cabin is the furthest uphill of all structures, overlooking neighboring cabins. It can accommodate up to 10 guests. Winter access may require skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles.</p>

The main road veers left along the creek bed. At this junction go uphill on FSR 10 and follow the signs to the Fremont Powerhouse.  In winter, access to FSR 10 may require snowmobiles, cross country skis, snowshoes or 4-wheel drive, depending on weather conditions. The closest plowed road comes within 1.2 miles of the cabin.
