overview: <p>Garner Cave is a rather heavily visited cave since it's close to the city. This hike is said to be on the difficult scale, and I probably wouldn't disagree. I have personally gone up there 3 times now but it's not the hardest hike I've done. </p><p>The cave has been visited by lots of people. There are a few spots that you could hurt yourself in there, but it's a pretty simple system for the most part. Don't do what you're not comfortable with doing.</p><p> </p>
tips: <p>You'll follow the canyon all the way in. It will split into two different canyons - go left. You'll go that way for a ways (climbing over walls of rock in a few points) and then you'll come to a point where there will be a ton of shale that has slid down over the trail. At this point you want to start heading to the right which will be toward the pine trees. You'll come to a big tree in the middle of the trail (it's up a ways but you'll know you're on the right track). After this, it's about another 200ft ahead and up a bit. You'll notice the rope there to climb in.</p><p>Bring these items with you to make your life easier in the cave - knee pads, gloves, head lamps. </p><p>Good luck. </p>
