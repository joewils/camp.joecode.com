sub_title: A wonderful family hike to beautiful alpine lake in the Little Cottonwood Canyons Albion Basin
overview: <p>This is a very short 1 mile hike to a beautiful alpine lake in the Albion Basin region near Alta and Snowbird Ski Resorts.  This area is very popular on summer weekends so parking may be difficult.  Take the time to relax at the lake and take lots of photos of your family with the mountains as a backdrop. </p>
tips: |-
  <p>Directions:
  From I-15 in Sandy, UT take exit #298 and head east on Highway 209 for 7 miles to where it joins 210 (Little Cottonwood Canyon Road).  At this junction (with a big flashing message sign) drive up Little Cottonwood Canyon for 11 miles to a parking lot on the left side of the road just before the Albion Basin Campground.   It is best to arrive early as sometimes the road is closed due to large weekend crowds. </p><p>          </p>
