note: ''
orientationDescription: <p>The small campground sits along the eastern shore of 314-acre Lake Inez. A dense conifer forest limits the visibility of the lake, but affords privacy between campsites. Plentiful shrubs and undergrowth give the 4,100-foot elevation campground beautiful colors during the fall.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Lake Inez is a popular spot for boating, jet skiing and fishing; however, the available boat ramp is not very developed. Non-motorized boating and swimming are also available and usually done away from high traffic watercraft use. Anglers can expect to see a variety of fish, from salmon to suckers, to pike, trout and perch.</p><p>The campground is a short distance from the Clearwater River Canoe Trail, which offers prime birding and wildlife viewing opportunities in a scenic setting. The water trail is popular with canoeists and kayakers as it stretches 3.5 miles, or a couple of hours, down the river.</p>
