orientationDescription: <p>The Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest showcases rugged peaks, sparkling alpine lakes and old-growth forests, providing visitors with unique and surprising landscapes.</p><p>Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness, dominates the landscape on a clear day. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, the active volcano is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.</p><p>Wildlife in the area includes mountain goats traversing the higher elevations to pine martens and porcupines in the forests. Migratory birds and native fish find ample habitat in the varied ecosystems as well.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The surrounding area is a prime location for hiking, climbing, boating, fishing, picnicking and horseback riding in summer and early fall, and skiing and snowshoeing in the winter months.</p><p>Baker Lake is a popular destination for boating, water skiing, canoeing, fishing and swimming. Anglers cast for kokanee, rainbow and cutthroat trout, salmon, native char and wild steelhead. The lake is within walking distance of the campground. Boat ramps are available at Horseshoe Cove, Swift Creek and Shannon Creek Campgrounds.</p><p>Baker Lake Trail is an easy family hike that begins in a majestic stand of Douglas fir. In 1843, a small eruption of Mt. Baker caused a forest fire, and visitors can still see the burned snags of virgin cedar trees that once dominated the area. The trail contours above the eastern shoreline of Baker Lake.</p><p>The Shadow of the Sentinels Trail begins just south of the campground. This  accessible interpretive trail winds through a 500-year old ancient forest. Displays along the path explain the dynamics of the forest. The trail is constructed of asphalt and boardwalks with grades no greater than 8%.</p>
