importantInformation: '<p>The Cove Palisades State Park features two overnight campgrounds separated by a distance of five miles. The Crooked River Campground consists of E loop and Cabins. It is located on the top of the canyon and provides electric and water hook-ups only (a dump station is near the entrance). Cabins are located lakeside at The Cove Marina and are open year round. **October 12, 2014 through February 25, 2015**Cabins will be closed for utility upgrades. Cabin and Gate access codes can be found in the Security Alerts section of your confirmation letter. You will need this information to enter Cabin area. Deschutes Campground consists of A, B, and C loops and Group Camps. It is located 5 miles from the park entrance down in the canyon bottom and provides full hookup and tent sites. Neither campground has lakefront campsites. Please remember that there is a 6 person and 2 vehicle maximum per site. 1st vehicle is included in cost of site. Each additional vehicle will be charged $5.00 per night (changing to $7.00 per night May 1, 2014). Additional vehicle fees are collected at the park. Parking is limited. All pets must be kept on a 6 foot leash, under physical control at all times and never left unattended. *Reservations for more than five nights/days that are later changed to fewer nights/days will be charged a fee equal to the nightly/daily site fee for each night/day canceled as well as the $8 transaction fee. Please be aware that only the person whose name is on the reservation may access, change or cancel the reservation. You can stay 14 consecutive nights in a single campground, and may return after spending at least three nights out of the park (it can be another state park campground; in fact, we recommend you DO select another state park campground). The maximum time allowed within any Oregon State Park is 14 nights within any 17 night period. Customers who wish to secure more than one site within a park for a continuous date period in order to accommodate their reservation request (i.e. split reservation), should be aware that the $8.00 reservation fee would apply to each site reserved. Reservation fee adjustments will not be made after reservations have been confirmed using the internet reservation service. If you are viewing inventory and find you are unable to secure one site to accommodate your request please consider calling the call center at 1-800-452-5687 to make your reservation. Discount programs which may be offered through the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department cannot be processed when making an internet reservation. For additional information on discount programs call the OPRD Information Center at 1-800-551-6949 or visit us online at www.OregonStateParks.org. Reservations can be made 24 hours a day, from 2 days to 9 months in advance. Campsite availability is based on call center hours, meaning sites become available when the call center opens. Call center hours are: Monday through Friday 8am to 5pm. </p>'
