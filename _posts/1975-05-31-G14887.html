sub_title: Beautiful flower meadows and a hike up the East side of Three Fingered Jack.
overview: <p>This very popular loop route takes you on a tour of a high alpine meadow, with bubbling Canyon Creek flowing through it. In addition, you&rsquo;ll enjoy spectacular views of the jagged spires of Three Fingered Jack, the eroded core of an extinct 100,000-year-old volcano.</p><p>This is a really beautiful hike with so many points of interest.&nbsp; From wildflower meadows, to the grassy hill up to Three Fingered Jack, to the glacial pool, to the saddle with views of the Sisters, Washington, Jefferson and of course Three Fingered Jack right next to you.</p><p>Many of the trees along the route were burned in 2003 during the B&amp;B Complex Fires.  Thankfully Canyon Creek Meadows itself was spared and still very beautiful. </p>
tips: <p>From Sisters, drive northwest on HWY 20 about 12 miles (8 miles East of Santiam Pass if you are coming from the West), then turn right on Forest Road 12, marked &quot;Mount Jefferson Wilderness Trailheads&quot;. Go North about 4 miles, then turn left of Forest Road 1230. Follow 1230 for about 1.5 miles then turn left on Forest Road 1234 (Jack Lake Road). Follow this road 6 miles to the parking area at Jack Lake. </p><p>Parking passes are required here. If you don't have one you can self-pay at a station just as you turn onto Forest Road 12. </p>
