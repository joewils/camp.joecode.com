seo_title: deceiver-trail
sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.
overview: <p>The Deceiver Trail is a great hike located in the southern portion of Cougar Mountain. While this trail is an easy hike, getting here will be a bit of a challenge .To get here you will have to make your way up the Wilderness Peak Trail and over the Long View Peak. </p><p>This trail starts at the top of Long View Peak; make your way down the trail towards the sound of rushing water. At the halfway point of the trail you will come to a fork in the trail. If you take the trail to the left you will come to Doughty Falls. On most days in the summer and fall, the waterfall is barely a trickle down some large moss covered rocks. If you wish to see the falls at their best plan a hike during the spring time after a few days of heavy rain.</p><p>Hiking back up to where the trail forks, you can now continue left to complete the Deceiver Trail. The rest of the trail takes you deeper into the forest as you make your way 1/2 mile to the end where the trail will meet up with Shy Bear Pass. If you have made it to the end you have the option to turn around and repeat the Deceiver Trail or you can make a right down Shy Bear Pass. Making a right on Shy Bear Pass will lead you in a large loop back towards the Wilderness Creek Trail from which you can head down the mountain towards the parking area. </p>
