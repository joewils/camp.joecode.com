sub_title: This nearly 12,000 peak of the most popular hikes in the Uinta Mountains of Utah
overview: <p>At nearly 12,000 feet but under a mile and half to the summit this mountain is a great start for beginners.  The trail is easy to follow and the views towards the many surrounding alpine lakes is spectacular.  Bring a camera. </p>
tips: <p>The best time to climb is July - September as highway 150 is closed in the winter anyway.  Take Highway 150 from Kamas, UT to the pass where you will find a pullout for the trailhead. </p>
