sub_title: Flat hike through a small canyon to bedrock pools along an old railroad track.
overview: <p>This is a very flat hike that follows an old railway.  The bridges along the trail have all been recently renovated with wooden planks (you can still spot some of the rail ties and metal along the trail).</p><p>The first section goes through cow pastures with several gates you need to pass though.  Make sure you close them as you walk through.</p><p>As you come across the rocks next to the creek be on the lookout for sunning groundhogs.  We also spotted several hawks flying overhead.</p><p>As you go deeper into Swale Canyon you will eventually come across the bedrock pools.  We saw a few butterfly in the area.</p><p>For those with a 2nd car, or on mountain bike you can continue down the trail 8 miles further to the town of Wahkiacus. </p>
tips: <p>From the Portland area, take I-84 east to the third Hood River Exit (exit 64), cross the Hood River Bridge to Washington, and turn right (east) on Hwy. 14. Go about 13 miles to the Klickitat River Bridge (the entrance to Lyle). From Lyle, take the paved Lyle-Centerville Hwy., which starts in the center of Lyle between the gas station and the Cafe. Head north and east for approximately 15 miles. Turn left on Harms Rd. Drive north one-half mile and park just north of the bridge. </p><p>There is a portable toilet at this location. </p><p>Bring along binoculars for bird/groundhog watching.</p><p>Bring sunscreen as much of the trail is uncovered. </p>
