sub_title: A trail in Silver Falls State Park past 10 beautiful waterfalls, perfect for the whole family.
overview: <p>This casual hike through a beautiful canyon in Oregon's largest State park takes you past TEN beautiful waterfalls ranging in height from 27 feet to 178 feet and 4 of them you can even walk behind!  There are plenty of benches to rest at and the trail is extremely well maintained, perfect for the whole family.  Before or after the amazing hike you can even enjoy some great coffee and food at the cafe and gift shop located next to the parking lot.  The park itself is 9,000 acres and contains over 24 miles of trails for biking and hiking but this trail is by far the best of all of them.  Definitely one of my favorite easy hikes in all of Oregon! </p>
tips: <p>Day use permits are required year round and as of this writing cost $5 with an annual pass costing $30.  Pets are allowed in the park and the picnic areas but are not allowed on the Canyon Trail of Ten Falls.  The park is open year round.  From my experience in the dryiest months of August and September the waterfalls lose much of their water but in the spring months and rainy winter months the falls are powerful but you might get wet on the walk.  I've tried to include photos of high flow and low flow times of year so you can get an idea of what the best time to go is. </p>
