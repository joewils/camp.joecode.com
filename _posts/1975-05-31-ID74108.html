orientationDescription: <p>The campground is situated in a mixed-growth pine forest, which offers plentiful shade. Summer wildflowers are abundant. The entire campground affords views of the river.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Because of its remote location, Deadwood Reservoir is quiet and unpopulated, making for great fishing for Atlantic, Chinook and Kokanee salmon, and rainbow and cutthroat trout. Boating, water skiing, canoeing and kayaking are popular on the lake. A boat ramp is located about 2 miles away at Cozy Cove Campground.</p><p>Many trails for hiking, mountain biking, horseback and off-road vehicle riding are in the area.</p>
