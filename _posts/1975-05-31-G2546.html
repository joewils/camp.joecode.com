sub_title: A stroll over the surface of the moon on volcanic glass from the Newberry Crater
overview: <p>There are few places in the continental United States where you can walk in a landscape so utterly foreign. The Big Obsidian Flow is a patch of black and grey volcanic glass covering about 4 square miles of the Newberry Crater floor. You can expect to see everything from the classic jet-black glass suited for Native American tools to frothy grey glass that looks more like a stone sponge than an arrowhead. </p><p>Throughout the flow, there are interpretive signs telling the history of the area, from the eruption 1300 years ago, to the colonization of plants and animals, to the use of the glass by native tribes and its trade throughout the west. </p>
tips: <p>The obsidian shards can be as sharp as a scalpel, so be sure to watch your footing and your handholds. This might not be a hike for young children or dogs, and it's certainly not one for flipflops.</p><p>There is NO shade on this hike, so be sure to bring water in the summer as the temps can get pretty high in the middle of all this black volcanic glass. </p>
