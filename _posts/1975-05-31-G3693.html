sub_title: 'This 4,000 foot peak with its rocky summit spire will provide you great views of Portland, Hood and the Columbia Gorge '
overview: '<p>This loop hike will start you off at the top of Larch Mountain at Sherrard Point just over 4,000 feet with fantastic views of 4 major Cascade Volcanoes!  Sherrard Point is an easy walk from the parking lot at the top of Larch Mountain Road.  This road is definitely not open in the winter so plan accordingly.  From here you will then take a loop hike around the crater of Larch Mountain down to Multnomah Creek and up to its headwaters which ultimately feed the famous Multnomah Falls in the Columbia Gorge.  Then you will traverse across the bottom of the crater to the Oneonta Trail which will bring you back to the parking lot.  </p><p>Note:  There are picnic areas near the top if you want to leave the family there while you go on this hike with the adventurous family members :) </p>'
tips: |-
  <p>Directions to Larch Mountain Highway:
  The highway is located off the Gorge Scenic Highway about 0.8 miles southwest of Crown Point near milepost 10.6.  It is a paved road to the summit.  It is open late May until the snow begins to fall.  There is no fee to park at the top.</p><p> </p>
