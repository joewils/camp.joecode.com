title: Tie Trail Loop - Mary's Peak East Ridge
seo_title: tie-trail-loop-marys-peak-east-ridge
sub_title: 'This is a fun loop variation of the standard Conors Camp Trail that includes a trip to the summit of Mary''s Peak '
overview: '<p>This is a nice loop hike to the summit of Mary''s Peak which provides some interesting views besides just taking the east ridge trail out and back from the summit.  The Tie Trail isn''t very difficult hiking (biking it can be tricky).  I called this a hike because technically the trail that leaves the East Ridge Trail at POI #2 and switchbacks to the top doesn''t allow bikes on it although I always see them on it when I''m there... your choice to follow the rules or not. </p>'
tips: |-
  <p>Connors Camp Directions.
  Follow Highway 34 west from Philomath for 10 miles then turn north from Highway 34 onto Marys Peak Road. In 5.5 miles you will reach Conner&rsquo;s Camp, the Lower East Ridge trailhead location. </p>
