Dozens of species of fish inhabit the lake, such as walleye, bass, rainbow trout, salmon and sturgeon; fishing for sturgeon is not allowed.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The boat launch is directly within the facility, so many recreation activities can take place from the campground, including boating, fishing and water skiing. However, the lake is not very accessible to swimmers since there is a rocky descent from the campground to the water.</p>
