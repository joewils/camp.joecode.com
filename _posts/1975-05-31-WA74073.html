orientationDescription: <p>The actual waterfalls of Kettle Falls are dormant under 80 feet of water formed by the backwaters of Grand Coulee Dam. The two group sites are spacious and set within a grove of locust trees, hence the name. They are near the site of Old Kettle Falls and overlooking Lake Roosevelt. Much of the water originates from glaciers and snow in the cold, high Canadian Rockies, though temperatures warm up in summer. The lake area is abundant with wildlife, including moose, elk, deer and bald eagles. Dozens of species of fish inhabit the lake, such as walleye, bass, rainbow trout, salmon and sturgeon. Fishing for sturgeon is not allowed.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The boat launch is in the main campground adjacent to the group sites, making the lake very accessible for boaters and fishermen. There is a former swimming beach at the group area; however, swimming conditions are not ideal.</p>
