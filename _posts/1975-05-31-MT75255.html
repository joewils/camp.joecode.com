orientationDescription: <p>The wooden tower was built in the 1930s and used as a fire lookout for several years. It is situated between the main highway and the Idaho border, at an elevation of 5,900 feet. With the growing use of aircraft for fire detection, fewer lookouts have been staffed in recent years and many are converted to cabin rentals available to the public.</p><p>The Lolo National Forest is home to many species of wildlife, from mule deer, whitetail deer, elk, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, black bear, mountain lions and moose, to many varieties of smaller animals and birds. Wildlife viewing areas offer guests ample opportunity to view animals in their natural habitat.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The Up Up Ridge Trail takes visitors into the spectacular Ward and Eagle peaks roadless area, where visitors will find several scenic alpine lakes and various points of exploration. The trail leads to other trails, which take hikers and mountain bikers to the 7,300-foot Eagle Peak, providing ample views of the surrounding area.</p><p>Big game hunters often camp along the ridge. It is also a great place to see vibrantly colored fall leaves, beautiful waterfalls, wildlife, do some berry picking and even fishing. The area holds many scenic and recreational attractions. The trail leads all the way to the Idaho state line, near Ward Peak.</p>
