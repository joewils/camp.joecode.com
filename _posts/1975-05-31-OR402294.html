importantInformation: '<p>This park may be confused with the Joseph Stewart State Park, located in Southern Oregon. If you reserve a cabin, please look for your access combination in the Security Alerts section of your confirmation letter. Both campground loops: Sites are spacious and open. There is not a lot of vegetation between the sites. Parking is extremely limited. There is no parking near the campsites for visitors coming out to visit for the day. Campsite visitors who are not staying the night must pay the $5 Day Use fee. Tents may be put up in each site however metal tent stakes must be used. The tent pad area is packed gravel and plastic stakes will not work. All equipment must be contained within the gravel site, including tents and shade covers. Check-in is allowed at 4:00 pm or later, Check-out is by 1:00 pm, strictly enforced. Dairy Creek East loop and Hares Canyon Horse Camp will close for the season on November 1. They will open again on March 1. *Reservations for more than five nights/days that are later changed to fewer nights/days will be charged a fee equal to the nightly/daily site fee for each night/day canceled as well as the $8 transaction fee. Please be aware that only the person whose name is on the reservation may access, change or cancel the reservation. You can stay 14 consecutive nights in a single campground, and may return after spending at least three nights out of the park (it can be another state park campground; in fact, we recommend you DO select another state park campground). The maximum time allowed within any Oregon State Park is 14 nights within any 17 night period. Customers who wish to secure more than one site within a park for a continuous date period in order to accommodate their reservation request (i.e. split reservation), should be aware that the $8.00 reservation fee would apply to each site reserved. Reservation fee adjustments will not be made after reservations have been confirmed using the internet reservation service. If you are viewing inventory and find you are unable to secure one site to accommodate your request please consider calling the call center at 1-800-452-5687 to make your reservation. Discount programs which may be offered through the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department cannot be processed when making an internet reservation. For additional information on discount programs call the OPRD Information Center at 1-800-551-6949 or visit us online at www.OregonStateParks.org. Reservations can be made 24 hours a day, from 2 days to 9 months in advance. Campsite availability is based on call center hours, meaning sites become available when the call center opens. Call center hours are: Monday through Friday 8am to 5pm. </p>'
