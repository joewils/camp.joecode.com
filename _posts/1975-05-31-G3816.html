title: Mirror Lake - Mount Hood
seo_title: mirror-lake-mount-hood
sub_title: An easy hike or snowshoe up to a small lake with fantastic views of Mt. Hood.
overview: '<p>This 3 mile round trip will bring you to a small lake beneath Tom Dick Peak which has beautiful views of Mt. Hood across the pass.  You can hike up the slope a bit further to POI #3 if you would like a view over Mirror Lake but I only suggest doing this in summer time as in the winter that slope is prone to avalanche.  Bring a camera and hope for calm winds as you will see a great reflection of the volcanoe in the lake. </p>'
tips: <p>Drive east on Rte. 26 from Portland.  Follow signs for Mt. Hood and the ski resorts.  The parking lot for the trailhead is on the last tight bend of the highway before it reaches Government Camp.  In the winter you'll want a snow park pass and in the summer you'll want a Northwest Forest Pass. </p>
