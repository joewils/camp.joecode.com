seo_title: mt-adams-standard-summit-route-ski-descent
sub_title: Via Cold Springs and South Spur
overview: <p>This is a challenging climb up a 12,000 foot volcano in southern Washington.   You'll climb close to 7,000 feet for this ski descent.  When you get up to the base of the glacier it will look like a highway of climbers in spring and summer months.  Hope for good snow as the descent is fantastic.  Beware - there is a false summit so be prepared to be disappointed as you crest what you think is the top, only to have to hike another half mile or so.  When you ski down get some speed from the true top and you might be able to make it partly up the false summit. </p>
tips: <p>Take highway 141 north from White Salmon through Hood River approx. 22 miles to Trout Lake.  From 1 mile north of the town go 1 mile on forest service road 23, then onto FS 80 on the right.  Stay on 80, then onto 8040 following signs for Cold Springs Campground.  The trail is on the north side of the campground.   You need obtain a climbing permit from the Trout Lake Ranger Station for $15.00 to park at Cold Springs and to climb. </p>
