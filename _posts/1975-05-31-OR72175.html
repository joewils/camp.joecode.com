importantInformation: '<p>Attention visitors: Short Creek Guard Station opened in 2011 for the first time to renters. In the past, hunters and hikers were allowed to fill up their water from the outside water faucet. Signs have been posted at the rental stating that water is no longer available to the public. However, you may still encounter a few long-time local people or long-time hunters who will stop and ask to use the water. You do have the right to say no to their requests. We are working to remedy this issue. The Malheur National Forest Recreation Department is working hard to ensure your safety and enjoyment while staying at all of our rentals. There is a locked gate at Short Creek Guard Station which is secured with a combination lock. The combination is provided in the customer confirmation email. Drinking water and the flush toilet are available only during warmer months; water will be shut off from early October until late May (specific dates depend on area temperatures to prevent freezing the lines) Bears may frequent the area; use appropriate containers for food and garbage ( learn more about bear safety ) Guests may encounter cattle near the facility Water taken from any outdoor source should be boiled or treated prior to consumption The cabin remains locked; a combination code will be contained in the reservation confirmation letter Guests should contact the Ranger Station before arrival to confirm that road closures or weather conditions won&apos;t affect a visit Learn more about the The Malheaur National Forest </p>'
