overview: |-
  <p>At only .8 miles the Primrose Trail seems like a quick detour, however, this trail offers some of the best sites to be seen. On this trail you will follow Coal Creek while making a few crossings of the creek via wooden bridges. Along the way you will also pass by Sand Stone Falls, one of Coal Creeks tributaries.</p><p>The Primrose Trail is named after a coal seam that was mined in the 1800's. While nature has covered up almost all traces of the mining activities there are a few artifacts that can be spotted along the trail.</p><p>I started my hike from the West Primrose trail marker.  The first thing that you will notice is that the trail marker is accompanied by a blue closed sign. I did not take notice of this sign as it was to the far right of the trail entrance. In fact I did not know this trail was even closed until I started making this guide and began to photograph my return trip. After researching the trail further I found out that the Primrose trail has been closed for a few years now due to the trail being washed out. While the trail is a bit rough in places, I found the trail to be easy to navigate. Along the way I found out that I was not alone, several other hikers were on the Primrose Trail with me. At that time I did not think to ask them about the trail closure since I was unaware of the closure.  I believe that many people still use this trail, you can tell by the worn trail and somebody has written &quot;just be careful&quot; on the East trail marker closed sign. With that being said the trail is &quot;closed&quot; but I will describe my hike on the Primrose Trail.</p><p>The trail starts out on a slight decline with the trail consisting of hard packed dirt. I came across some blackberry bushes and began to hear the sound of Coal Creek flowing just ahead. When I approached the creek the trail became narrower and I could see a small drop off where part of the trail has eroded away. The trail widens up a bit and again I was walking among ferns and blackberry bushes. For the next few tenths of a mile I followed the creek almost never losing site of it until I came upon Sand Stone Falls. While the falls are not as impressive when compared to the larger Coal Creek Falls, I always enjoy water features on a trail. The falls appear to come from a large black pipe at the top. The water gently trickles down the rocks incline rather than the typical crashing that you would see from other waterfalls. Once past the falls I came across a wooden bridge which crosses over the creek.  The bridge did not look sturdy and a laminated &quot;walk&quot; sign was posted on it. I was to close to the end of the trail to turn back now and decided to press on. Every step that I took on the bridge caused it to shake. I tested each plank before I committed my full weight and continued slowly to the other side. Once on the other side I noticed that many of the screws that were holding the bridge together have now come loose. I&rsquo;m just glad it held together for my crossing. With the bridge behind me the trail began to climb slightly uphill. On one of the first sets of switchbacks I came across another mining artifact, a pair of coal car axles. Past the axles the trail gets muddier and steeper, however this only lasts about .3 miles as I made my way back to the Coal Creek Trail.</p><p>This is a great trail with many sites to see while hiking along Coal Creek. I hope that with the current work being done to the Coal Creek Trail, this trail receives some attention and can be reopened soon.
