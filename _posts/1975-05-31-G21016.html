seo_title: rock-creek-escure-ranch-desert-waterfalls
sub_title: Go for the desert waterfalls and incredible views.  Perfect hiking in the winter!!!
overview: <p>Great winter hiking, if you don't mind snakes, its worth it in the summer (but could get really hot).  Stunning photography of mesas, arroyos and waterfalls.  Easy to adjust the hike to the distance you want.  Be a great family hike. </p><p>&bull; Wonderful story about this being a sheep ranch.  You can imagine people living out here in the old days. </p>
tips: <p>If you are viewing this on the phone App - go online for web links to park resources, trail video, and 360&ordm; panorama interactive photos - www.everytrail.com</p><p>&bull; In the summer - bring lots of water, double what you think you will consume.  By and large, people underestimate their water needs, especially in the desert. </p><p>&bull; I don't want to scare people way, but there are rattle snakes out here.  We came across three in late April.  If you stick to the main road/trail, you can easily spot them if they are crossing the road - we only saw one crossing.  Just beware, lots of people think there are no rattle snakes in northeastern Washington, which is not true.  Also, this area is heavy with ticks in tick season - April through June is the hight of the season. </p><p>&bull; This area does not have any hiking fees.</p><p>&bull; Dogs must be under the owners control.  During the worse of the tick season, leave them home.  With the snakes, leash them late March to early October. </p>
