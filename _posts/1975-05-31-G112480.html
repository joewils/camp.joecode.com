overview: <p>9.4 miler Bommer Cyn to Laguna Trails is located near Irvine, California. The trail is great for hiking and normally takes about 3 hours or 3.5, all depending on your pace, of course.</p><p>I did this to give you an extended hike out of Bommer Canyon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Trails are good, area is quiet.  You do see several other hikers, runners and bikers.  </p><p>Travel in on Shady Canyon Road, and about 1.5 - 2 miles in, you will see a right turn into Bommer Canyon (there is no light , and the driveway sneaks up on you).  </p><p>If you are lucky enough to get one  of the 14 parking spots, this will be your starting point.  Otherwise, you can park nearby and walk in for another 7/10 mile (one direction).&nbsp;&nbsp;If the parking lot at Bommer Canyon is full, continue down Shady Canyon Road to Springhill, and turn left.  Park in lot on your left, in the area for &quot;trail parking&quot;. Signs will guide  you to the trail, and add 1.4 miles to the mileage I have listed here, for an accurate round-trip accounting.There are bathrooms, water, and a picnic table at base of Bommer Canyon.  And a large map of trails is posted, although for this hike we continue on and switch to Laguna maps.  The Laguna maps are shown in the photos.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you do start out, you meander through the fields, over a couple of bridges.  Within the first mile, you have a choice between Nature Loop and Bommer Meadow; choose the Nature Loop.  Just follow the trail.  It leads you nicely, and you really can't go wrong. &nbsp;First 1 mile is slightly inclined (from picnic area).  Hills are dotted with impressive homes, which you will soon be leaving behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;At about  1.8 miles, there is a fork in the road (Turtle Ridge vs West Fork).  Take West Fork trail (to your left), it is uphill for next 1 mile.  Not too tricky, but hiking shoes help.  You do get a break at about .65 miles up - a little flat area as you go under the 73 toll road, then steep incline to top (Park Ridge).</p><p>At Park Ridge you will find several new trails to explore.For this hike, we choose Bommer Ridge, and followed it to post 8. &nbsp;At Post 8, we headed towards ocean to Red Tail Ridge, then down Ticketron to meet back up with NoName, which returns us to Park Ridge. From there, we just followed our path in - returning down West Fork to Bommer.The photos show you the trails, and the Laguna maps. </p>
tips: <p>Ticketron can be slippery.  Hiking shoes recommended.  Hat and std gear always recommended.</p>
