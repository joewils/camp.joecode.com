sub_title: In this guide you will be exploring the many trails around little Bald Hill just outside of town
overview: <p>This is a great area to bring dogs.  The trails here are super easy. These are literally all the trails in the area (and 2 unknown secret ones).  A paved path runs along the base of Bald Hill and there are numerous single track trails great for hiking or mountain biking.  You'll probably also eat a lot of blackberries if you time the year right. </p>
tips: <p>Many different free parking options off Oak Creek Road in North Corvallis, at the Corvallis Fairgrounds, or off SW Reservoir Ave. </p>
