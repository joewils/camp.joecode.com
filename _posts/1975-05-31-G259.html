sub_title: 'A hike from The Johnston Ridge Observatory, across the pumice planes, and part way up Mt. Saint Helens to Loowit Falls. '
overview: <p>A great hike from the Johnston Ridge Observatory, across the pumice planes in the devastated area destroyed in the 1980 eruption, and part of the way up the mountain to beautiful Loowit Falls.</p><p>Mt. St. Helens is in Washington State.  It's about sixty miles off highway five about 70 miles from Porland and about a hundred and fifty miles south of Seattle.  It can be reached from the south, the west, and the northwest sides.  Once a 9,700 ft cone-shaped stratovolcano, Mt. St. Helens erupted in 1980 sending an ash cloud thousands of feet high. the explosion blew off the top and north side of the mountain, and devastated the forests for miles.  The mountain is now a national monument and a research site on the re-emergence of a forest from complete annihilation. Thirty years later, moss covers the ground as far as the eye can see, wildflowers bloom as tiny streams weave their way across the plains, and tiny trees and bushes sprout up from the soil in a reminder to us all that life will find a way.</p><p>The hike to Loowit Falls is an all day hike, 8.5 miles one way!  Get started early and bring a headlamp just in case you get back during the evening. </p>
tips: <p>Bring lots of water and sunscreen because there is no shade on this hike.  Get up early because this is a full day hike and you will be running up against darkness if the going is slow.  Bring a headlamp just in case. </p>
