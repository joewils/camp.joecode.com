description: <p>Liz Butte Cabin is truly a mountain hideaway, situated on top of Liz Butte at 6,098 feet above sea level. This rustic log cabin was built in the 1930s and used as a  home for Forest Service lookout guards who spent their days on the tower scanning the horizon for signs of fire. The lookout tower no longer exists.</p><p>Access to the cabin is via the Lolo Motorway, a primitive, single-lane road constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the early 1930s. It is not recommended for large RVs, vehicles with low ground clearance or trailers.</p><p>The cabin is primitive and offers few amenities, so guests should be prepared to bring most of the gear and supplies they&amp;#39;ll need for a comfortable stay. The cabin can be accessed by car, but the last half-mile is steep and rocky. High clearance vehicles are recommended.</p>
