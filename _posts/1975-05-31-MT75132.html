orientationDescription: <p>The rustic cabin was built before 1914 and was restored in 1987. It was originally a guard station, used by fire watchers in the forest. It is situated on the East Fork of Bitterroot River, at an elevation of about 4,500 feet.</p><p>The river flows west from within the Anaconda-Pintler Wilderness, to just south of Conner, Montana, where it joins the West Fork of the Bitterroot River to form the Bitterroot River. During the spring the river becomes a dangerous combination of fast water and snags.</p><p>The Anacondas are home to abundant wildlife, including mountain lions, elk, deer, moose and bears ( learn about outdoor safety ).</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Fishing is popular in the nearby river. A variety of trout, including brown, rainbow, cutthroat and brook, can be found in the area between Sula and Conner. Winter fishing for whitefish is popular and productive, as the river is closed to trout fishing during the colder months. The catch along the East Fork is fairly evenly divided between bait, spin and fly fishermen.</p><p>The surrounding hills and valleys are popular for hiking, backpacking and horseback riding in the summer and fall. Cross country skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling can be enjoyed in the area during the winter ( learn more about avalanche safety ). Winter sports enthusiasts can enjoy more than 50 miles of groomed trails, along with a number of unmarked trails that are open for recreation.</p>
