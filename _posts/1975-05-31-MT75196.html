description: <p>Mystic Lake Cabin was built in 1930 and is currently open year-round. It provides access to a variety of recreational activities, including fishing, hunting and exploration of numerous trails.</p><p>The cabin is located in a non-motorized area. Guests must be prepared to hike, horseback ride or mountain bike to get there in the summer, and winter access is by cross-country skis or snowshoes.  Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.</p>
drivingDirection: '<p> Two trails lead to the cabin:   The New World Gulch Trail is 5.5 miles and is the more challenging option. The Bozeman Creek Trail is about 10 to 12 miles with two routes.</p><p> Directions to the New Gulch Trailhead:</p><p> From Bozeman:   Travel east on Interstate 90 for 4.5 miles, to the Bear Canyon Exit. Head west for a half-mile, to Bear Canyon Road. Follow Bear Canyon Road for 3.5 miles to the New World Gulch parking area, which is about a quarter mile before the old Bozeman Ski Lodge. Please make sure to park away from the road.</p><p>The New World Gulch Trail (Trail 50) is approximately 5.5 miles of steep trail to Mystic Lake Cabin. The first 2.5 miles of trail through State of Montana land closely follows the creek bed and climbs to a meadow. This part of the trail is steep with even steeper pitches. The meadow roughly marks the National Forest Boundary. At 2.5 miles the trail forks; continue left to Mystic Lake (the right fork heads right back to the New World Gulch trailhead via a loop). The trail then climbs slightly through lodgepole and spruce stands to the boundary between New World Gulch and the Bozeman Creek at about 3.7 miles. From the divide, the trail drops down to the northwest shoreline and meets the Bozeman Creek Trail 457. The Mystic Lake Cabin is on the southeast side of Mystic Lake.</p><p> Directions to the Bozeman Creek Trailhead:</p><p> From Bozeman:   At the junction of West Main Street and South 19th Avenue: follow South 19th Ave. for 5.1 miles to Nash Road. Go turn left and go east on Nash for 1.7 miles. Turn right onto Sourdough Canyon Road. The parking area is a mile south on Sourdough Canyon Road.   The Bozeman Creek Trail (Trail 454) follows Bozeman Creek for the first several miles. At approximately 5 miles there is a fork closely followed by a bridge. Take the narrow single track trail to the left (Trail 457) for about 5 more miles to Mystic Lake and the New World Gulch Trail (Trail 50) junction; this route stays on the north side of Bozeman Creek. If you wish to continue on the old road bed for a slightly longer but more mellow trip, take the right fork across the bridge. This route is about 7 miles to Mystic Lake Cabin on the south side of the creek and is the popular route for skiing.</p>'
facilitiesDescription: <p>The cabin has bunk beds with mattresses to sleep up to four people. A wood-burning cook stove also heats the cabin. Other amenities include a table with chairs, basic cookware, dishes and tableware. Firewood is supplied for the stove.</p><p>Outside is a campfire ring and a corral for up to two horses. An outhouse is equipped with a vault toilet.</p><p>No electricity or water is available at the cabin. Guests need to bring their own supply of drinking water, as well as items such as fire starters (matches and newspaper), flashlights or lanterns, bedding, extra toilet paper, first aid supplies and dish soap, which are also not provided. The cabin will need to be cleaned and all trash removed prior to leaving.</p>
