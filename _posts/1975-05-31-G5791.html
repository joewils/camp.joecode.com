  We took the chances to travel Rila Maountain for four days and make a wonderfull trip this summer. Some people take the distance for 6-7 days. We had some exercise training before the trip and we loved the challenge so we took it for 4 days. </p><p>The distance was not a problem ~20km per day. Neither we had problems with our legs, despite my blisters. The thing that got us were our backpacks. As an unexperienced hikers, we took too much stuff! My backpack was the killing 20kg and my girlfriend's one 15kg.</p><p>At first you dont feel the backpack but after 5,6 hours of treking it feels like rock on your back. If we had 10kg less weight it would have been a breeze. Now it was hard at times. Especially on the hardest Day 3.</p><p>We sleped only at Huts because we did not have a tent.
  We regret it though during the trip, because there were unbelivably wonderful places for camping. </p><p>The Chez guys we were meeting in Rila were camping everywhere. </p>
tips: <p>As an unexperienced hikers, we took too much stuff! Leave whatever possible at home!:)</p><p>Take Poles, they help a lot, absorb may be ~30% of the weight.</p><p>If you like camping, take a tent. There are wonderfull places for camping. </p>
