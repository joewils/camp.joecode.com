sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park
overview: <p>This trail can be accessed from two different routes. The quickest route is to hike up the Squak Mountain Connector Trail from the base of the mountain and continue up onto this trail. This is also the most direct route to reach the peak.</p><p>The hike up to the peak on this section of the trail can be difficult when compared to other trails located within the park. To aid in your ascent of Wilderness peak, you will find many switchbacks. Luckily most of the trail is shaded by the thick canopy of trees, making the trail a little cooler. Overall this trail will provide a small you with a small challenge. It is a good warm up hike early in the season before taking on those longer and steeper hikes. </p>
