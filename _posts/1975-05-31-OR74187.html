description: <p>Willow Prairie Cabin is located in the southwest portion of the magnificent volcanic Cascade Mountain Range at the foot of Mt. McLoughlin, at an elevation of 4,300 feet. The Willow Prairie Guard Station cabin was constructed on the edge of the meadow in 1924 by a Forest Service road crew.  Its main purpose at that time was as a firefighter guard station.</p><p>In 1990, the cabin was converted to a horse camp and was recently restored by local volunteers and employees of the Butte Falls Ranger District. Today it is available for rent by groups with or without horses.</p>

Turn west on Forest Service Road 3738 and drive 1.3 miles to the intersection of Forest Service Road 3735. Continue west across the intersection, off the main road, and on to a little dirt road. At the next junction, turn left and the cabin will soon be in sight.   Wheeled-vehicle access is usually possible only from late spring through fall. Vehicle access in winter is subject to weather conditions. Winter parking along Highway 140 is permissible in designated areas with an Oregon State Sno-Park permit. Winter access on skis or snowmobiles can range from 2 to 6 miles, and the difficulty level will be moderate to difficult depending on snow conditions.  </p>

orientationDescription: <p>The Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest is composed of two distinct geological provinces - the Cascade Range and the Siskiyou Mountains.</p><p>The Cascade Range is dominated by snow-capped volcanic peaks such as 9,495 foot Mt. McLoughlin located within the Sky Lakes Wilderness. The Siskiyou area embodies the most complex and treasured plant communities in the Pacific Northwest. Wild rivers, biological diversity, remarkable fisheries resources, and complex watersheds define the Siskiyou.</p><p>Adjacent to the cabin and camp is a wetland area featuring a beaver swamp and several large ponds where wildlife abounds.  From majestic sandhill cranes and Canada geese, to bull elk and deer, these species, along with many others, depend on the surrounding undeveloped wilderness, undisturbed wetlands, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The cabin is adjacent to the Willow Prairie Campground , and is surrounded by 19 plus miles of horse trails. In addition to horseback riding, enjoy camping, hunting and winter sports, such as cross country skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling.   The wetlands adjacent to the cabin provide an excellent area for birding enthusiasts to watch for sandhill cranes, great blue herons, Canada geese, ducks and red-tailed hawks.</p>
