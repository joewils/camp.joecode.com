importantInformation: '<p>Please note that Emigrant Springs State Park is located in Eastern Oregon near Pendleton. Emigrant Lake, also known as Emigrant Reservoir, is in Jackson County, near Ashland. The Group Camp at Emigrant Springs is now reservable. If you reserve a cabin, please look for your access combination in the Security Alerts section of your confirmation letter. Between Oct 15 - 31 water may be shut down to campsites and cabins on short notice due to weather conditions.Water at campsites and cabins is turned off during winter, and will be turned back on in the spring as soon as weather permits.Water is available at the restroom and shower building. Between Oct 15 and Apr 30 each year most of the park is closed. The cabins and sites B21, B23, and B25 remain open and reservable. Two other campsites remain open to walk in customers.More sites may open for walk in depending on weather.Call park for additional information. The Community building may be reserved through the park directly.Call 541-983-2277 *Reservations for more than five nights/days that are later changed to fewer nights/days will be charged a fee equal to the nightly/daily site fee for each night/day canceled as well as the $8 transaction fee. Please be aware that only the person whose name is on the reservation may access, change or cancel the reservation. You can stay 14 consecutive nights in a single campground, and may return after spending at least three nights out of the park (it can be another state park campground; in fact, we recommend you DO select another state park campground). The maximum time allowed within any Oregon State Park is 14 nights within any 17 night period. Customers who wish to secure more than one site within a park for a continuous date period in order to accommodate their reservation request (i.e. split reservation), should be aware that the $8.00 reservation fee would apply to each site reserved. Reservation fee adjustments will not be made after reservations have been confirmed using the internet reservation service. If you are viewing inventory and find you are unable to secure one site to accommodate your request please consider calling the call center at 1-800-452-5687 to make your reservation. Discount programs which may be offered through the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department cannot be processed when making an internet reservation. For additional information on discount programs call the OPRD Information Center at 1-800-551-6949 or visit us online at www.OregonStateParks.org. Reservations can be made 24 hours a day, from 2 days to 9 months in advance. Campsite availability is based on call center hours, meaning sites become available when the call center opens. Call center hours are: Monday through Friday 8am to 5pm. </p>'
