importantInformation: '<p>Welcome to Loeb State Park. Thank you for selecting Loeb State Park as your recreation site. This park now accepts reservations for cabins only. RV/tent campsites are all first come/first served and must be physically occupied the first night they are registered and paid for. Visitors may not save sites that will not be occupied. Shower Hours to limit water usage, 7AM to 10PM. To contact Loeb State Park, please call Harris Beach State Park at (541) 469-2021. Alfred A, Loeb State Park will be closed from October 1, 2013 to late spring 2014 for an electric upgrade and paving project. The park is currently scheduled to reopen May 21, 2014. Opening date may change depending on progress of the paving project. *Reservations for more than five nights/days that are later changed to fewer nights/days will be charged a fee equal to the nightly/daily site fee for each night/day canceled as well as the $8 transaction fee. Please be aware that only the person whose name is on the reservation may access, change or cancel the reservation. You can stay 14 consecutive nights in a single campground, and may return after spending at least three nights out of the park (it can be another state park campground; in fact, we recommend you DO select another state park campground). The maximum time allowed within any Oregon State Park is 14 nights within any 17 night period. Customers who wish to secure more than one site within a park for a continuous date period in order to accommodate their reservation request (i.e. split reservation), should be aware that the $8.00 reservation fee would apply to each site reserved. Reservation fee adjustments will not be made after reservations have been confirmed using the internet reservation service. If you are viewing inventory and find you are unable to secure one site to accommodate your request please consider calling the call center at 1-800-452-5687 to make your reservation. Discount programs which may be offered through the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department cannot be processed when making an internet reservation. For additional information on discount programs call the OPRD Information Center at 1-800-551-6949 or visit us online at www.OregonStateParks.org. Reservations can be made 24 hours a day, from 2 days to 9 months in advance. Campsite availability is based on call center hours, meaning sites become available when the call center opens. Call center hours are: Monday through Friday 8am to 5pm. </p>'
