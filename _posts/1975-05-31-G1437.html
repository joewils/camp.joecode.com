sub_title: Via State Highway 140 and the Mt. McLoughlin Trail with optional ski descent.
overview: <p>This is an unbelievable ski descent where you can literally ski all the way back to your car without pushing with your poles very much.  The trail is pretty hard to follow in the spring so make sure to follow the gps track in this guide.  When you get up onto the East ridge take a look at the pinnacles within the Eastern Bowl.  This is where I descended but the safer route would be to descend via the broad summit slope where the ascent track is.  Lots of options for ski descents on this mountain.  Pick the one you feel most comfortable on and as always make sure snow conditions are safe. </p>
tips: '<p>To Trailhead: From White City, OR drive east on State Route 140.  When you pass Fish lake keep an eye out for Forest Service Road 3650.  Drive 2.5 miles down this to the clearly marked Mt. Mcloughlin trailhead.  A Northwest Forest Pass is required. </p>'
