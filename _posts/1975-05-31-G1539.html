sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.
overview: <p>The China Creek Trail starts at a service gate entrance to the right of the Cougar Mountain information booth. The trail is a short .3 mile trail on a wide, gravel, park service road. </p><p>Once you get past the service gate you will begin walking South on the gravel road. The trail starts out fairly flat, on your left you will see a grass clearing. There are no picnic tables here but the space is large enough to have lunch if you brought a blanket or some chairs with you. Continuing on the road you will come to a fork in the road, to the right is the service road entrance, to the left the trail continues. A wooden trail marker will be located at the intersection just to the left. Shortly after turning left you will come to another service gate, pass through over the logs on your left. The trail begins to gain in elevation but only slightly. You will also become surrounded by the forest as you get deeper into the park. A few feet away from the service gate you can see another trail head marker; this one will lead you to the Rainbow Town Trail. Continuing straight on the China Creek Trail you will notice that the trail narrows slightly and becomes slightly steeper. At the end of the trail you will come to a clearing and find yourself at the end of a neighborhood block. This is the end of the China Creek Trail, you can now walk back to explore other trails within the park or retrace your steps back to the parking area.</p><p>This trail is not the most scenic trail you will come across, not even close. However, it does offer a quick route to the Rainbow Town Trail and is a nice beginner trail for those new to running off roads. </p>
