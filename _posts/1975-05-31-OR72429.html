orientationDescription: <p>The cabin is situated at the base of Southern Oregon&amp;#39;s Mount Bailey in Umpqua National Forest, near scenic Diamond Lake. Mount Bailey is a popular ski  destination, averaging 600 inches of snow per year and boasting 6,000 acres of ideal skiing terrain.</p><p>Mount Bailey, part of the Cascade Mountain Range, is a shield volcano topped with a 2,000-foot tephra cone. The mountain is heavily forested with pine at lower  elevations, which gives way to hemlock and fir at higher elevations. The peak rises above treeline and crests at 8,363 feet.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Several winter recreation trails crisscross the area. The Hemlock Butte Trail, which is used to access the cabin, is a challenging backcountry ski experience. Skiers on this trail can enjoy views of Mount Thielsen, Mount Bailey and even the rim of Crater Lake on a clear day.</p><p>Advanced skiers can make the difficult trek up Mount Bailey, a 2-mile trip from the cabin with an elevation gain of 3,300 feet.</p><p>Skiers should make sure to have proper backcountry equipment and be aware of  avalanche dangers .</p>
