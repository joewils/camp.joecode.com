title: Middle and North Sister Summit Climb
seo_title: middle-and-north-sister-summit-climb
sub_title: Via Obsidian Trail approach from the west
overview: <p>This is a nice challenging summer mountaineering trip that will bag you both North and Middle Sister in an overnight starting from the Obsidian Trailhead on Mckenzie Pass Scenic Highway.  This trip takes you through beautiful alpine meadows, through massive lava flows and then up two 10,000 ft. volcanoes.  You will sleep in the col between the two peaks.  Middle sister is challenging but doable by the average climber while North Sister's summit pitch is extremely steep and could be considered 5+ climbing.  Use the attached GPS track to find the precise route up to the top as it can be tricky to find. </p>
tips: |-
  <p>Directions to trailhead:
  Drive 16.7 miles from the turnoff of HWY 126 near Santiam Pass.</p><p>Note: As you can see from the GPS track we were forced to start our trip further down the Scenic Highway due to a gate being closed from fallen trees.  We simply walked the couple miles up the trail and then headed into the woods via a lava flow to cut off a bit of the trail.  To start directly from the Obsidian trailhead start from where the GPS track hits the road at the higher elevation where you will find parking. </p><p>A Northwest Forest Pass is required to park here. </p>
