orientationDescription: <p>The Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest offers visitors the chance to explore the region&amp;#39;s rugged peaks, scenic rivers, and interesting wildlife within the forest and surrounding designated wilderness areas.</p><p>Visitors will find unique ecosystems along the banks of the Stillaguamish River. Old-growth forests of cedar, fir and hemlock line the wide, gently-flowing river and tower over trails winding through moss-covered rocks.</p><p>On a clear day visitors will see Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, the active volcano is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.</p><p>Undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests provide important habitat for wildlife, including birds, amphibians, reptiles and more rare species such as lynx, moose, wolves, and wolverine. Grizzly bear sightings have been confirmed in the Cascade region, though black bears are more common.</p>
