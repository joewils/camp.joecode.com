description: <p>The Todd Family began building Deer Creek Cabin in 1953 and finished it in 1960. They used it as a retreat while they grazed cattle on federal lands in the summer and hunted in the fall. The cabin has survived two forest fires. Gallatin National Forest assumed ownership of the cabin in 1993.</p><p>The cabin is open year-round, but access is challenging. There are two routes to the cabin that can be used by equestrians and hikers in the summer or by snowshoers and skiers in the winter. These 4- to 5-mile routes ford creeks many times, with creek depths varying from 6 inches to several feet.</p><p>Some basic conveniences are provided, but guests will need to bring several of their own amenities to ensure a comfortable stay.</p>
drivingDirection: '<p>Deer Creek Cabin is located approximately 30 miles south of Big Timber, Montana. It can be accessed by 2 different routes for the last 4 to 5 miles. It is recommendedthat renters carry topographic maps, GPS and compasses for navigation since the route may be difficult to find.   The easier route to follow is along Lower Deer Creek Road and the Placer Gulch Trailhead:  From Exit 370 on Interstate 90 just east of Big Timber, take Frontage Road (south side of the interstate) 8 miles east. Turn right (south) onto Lower Deer Creek Road (Forest Service Road #482) and proceed 16.2 miles to the Placer Gulch Trailhead sign located on the left side of the road. Park at the trailhead and travel Placer Gulch Trail 256 by foot or horse (no off-road vehicles allowed) a distance of 3.7 miles, to the intersection with Lower Deer Creek Trail 5. Turn right (south) on Trail 5 for 1.5 miles to the Deer Creek Cabin. Note: both trails have several creek crossings and Trail 256 has a number of switchbacks.  West Bridger Creek access by foot or horse:  From Big Timber, travel 14 miles east on Interstate Highway 90 to Exit 384, Bridger Creek. At the stop sign, turn rightand travel south for 8.2 miles to the junction of Main Bridger with West Bridger Creek Road. Turn right and continue on West Bridger Road for 4 miles, to the parking area. Park near the sign for West Bridger Trail 129, Lower Deer Creek. From this point, the cabin is 4 miles by foot or horse. Follow trail 129 up Jim&apos;s Gulch for about a mile, where the trail turns sharply to the right (north) and climbs up to the ridge.  Follow the trail to the divide where it descends steeply to Lower Deer Creek.  At this point, the trail junctions with Lower Deer Creek Trail 5. Turn left (south) on Trail 5 and follow the trail upstream for approximately 1.5 miles to the cabin.  During winter months, the road to the trailhead may not be plowed and could be impassable to both passenger cars and four-wheel drive vehicles.
