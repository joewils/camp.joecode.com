Some areas of the campground are more open and sunny than others.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Island Park Reservoir offers boating, water skiing, fishing and canoeing. A boat ramp is located within the campground. The reservoir is used for irrigation so the water level recedes throughout the summer and by August, the reservoir cannot be accessed from McCrea Bridge.</p><p> The Island Park area is renowned for its fishing; Henry&amp;#39;s Fork is considered one of the best fly-fishing streams in the nation. Anglers cast for rainbow, cutthroat and brook trout and Kokanee salmon.</p><p>  Hiking, biking, horseback riding and ATVing are popular activities. Many miles of trails are in the area, including the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail and the Nez Perce Trail.</p><p>  The Big Springs National Recreation Water Trail offers a roughly three-hour float or canoe trip through beautiful scenery. Wildlife, including moose, bald eagles and Sandhill cranes, are often seen along the trail.</p>
