sub_title: A fun ski descent of the Northeast Ridge of the Coast Range's Tallest Mountain.
overview: <p>This is a fun ski descent of Mary's Peak on her Northeast Ridge.  Even in winter you should be able to fairly easily make out where the trail is going up but follow the attached gps track anyway.  On the descent have fun on the broad upper slopes of the summit but then on the descent through the open trees stick close to your ascent track as you don't want to ski down a wrong drainage as there are many and the tall trees make it hard to figure out exactly where you are.   </p>
tips: |-
  <p>Directions to North Ridge Trailhead:
  Drive two miles west of Hwy 34 and Hwy 20 junction in Philomath, turn off of Hwy 20 on to Woods Creek Road. Travel 7.5 miles up Woods Creek Road to the closed Forest Service gate. </p>
