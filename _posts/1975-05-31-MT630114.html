importantInformation: <p> ADA designated campsites may only be reserved and occupied by a party who can provide proof of disability upon arrival. Proof of eligibility for at least one member of your party will be required in the form of a DMV (or other states equivalent) issued person with disabilities placard or disabilities motor vehicle license plate. The eligible member of your party must be an occupant of the site for the entire reserved period. Failure to comply with these requirements will result in the cancellation of your reservation and forfeiture of your reservation fee. Additional cancellation fees will be applied. Some yurts, cabins and group facilities are ADA accessible and do not require proof of disability upon arrival. Camping is allowed in designated areas only. All boats, trailers, rigs and motorized vehicles must fit entirely within the campsite parking-spur provided. Any equipment that does not fit entirely within the campsite parking-spur must be parked outside the campground in an area designated by the park manager. If no outside parking is available, a second campsite must be purchased. Check-in time is 2:00pm for campsites and 3:00pm for yurts, cabins and tipis&apos;s (local time). Check-out time is 1:00pm for campsites and 12:00pm for yurts, cabins, and tipis (local park time). Late checkouts may incur additional fees unless prior arrangements have been made with park staff. The maximum capacity at each individually signed or numbered campsite is eight (8) people. This typically involves a single camping unit, which includes, but not limited to, a tent, motor home, camping bus, truck mounted camper shell, pull-type camper, or other device designed and commonly used for sleeping. In the event the site is designated as Double Site, the site capacity for that site is doubled to allow for sixteen (16) people and two camping units. Campfires are allowed in designated areas only! Pets must be kept on a leash. Please check with destination park staff for local restrictions. Quiet hours are enforced from 10:00pm to 7:00am. Fireworks are prohibited in all parks at all times. No Exceptions.</p>
