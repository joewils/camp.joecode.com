orientationDescription: <p>The Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest offers visitors the chance to explore the region&amp;#39;s rugged peaks, scenic rivers, and exciting wildlife in the forest and surrounding designated wilderness areas.</p><p>On banks of the Stillaguamish River, visitors can explore portions of the unique ecosystems typical of the area. Old-growth forests of cedar, fir, and hemlock line the wide, gently-flowing river and tower over trails of underbrush and spring flowers.</p><p>On a clear day visitors will see Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, the active volcano from which the forest takes its name is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers.  Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.   Undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests provide important habitat for wildlife to thrive in this region, including lynx, moose, wolves and wolverine.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>In addition to being a prime location for hiking, fishing, picnicking, and horseback riding in summer and early fall, visitors can take advantage of skiing and snowshoeing in the winter months.</p><p>Anglers will enjoy fishing from the gently-flowing Stillaguamish River or neighboring Old Mill Pond.  The Stillaguamish sustains a large salmon and trout population including chinook, coho, chum, pink, and sockeye salmon, steelhead trout, sea-run cutthroat and bull trout.</p><p>Fishing is best in the summer months, though crisp, autumn evenings provide a delightful backdrop for those looking to cast a line in greater solitude.</p>
