overview: <p>In 2005 Woodpecker Loop trail was recognized as a National Recreation Trail. This loop trail begins and ends at the parking lot. </p><p>The trail begins in a oak woodland habitat and then climbs slightly to an overlook that allows exceptional views of the valley and the Cascade Range. Here you also get a good view of Bald Top, which is a native oak savannah habitat. </p><p>The trail continues on into a forest dominated by Douglas fir. As the trail drops down you start to see mature maples and evidence of past logging practices. Interpretive signs throughout the trail provide information about different animals and their habitats. </p>

Turn west on Finley Road. </p><p>Woodpecker Loop trail head is located just off Finley Refuge road</p><p>This is an excellent trail for bird watching and is enjoyable in the summertime because most of the trail is under the forest canopy. </p>
