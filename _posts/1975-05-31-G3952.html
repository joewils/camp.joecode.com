title: MacDunn Forest Quad Burner - For Oregon State University Mountain Bikers

sub_title: This killer route from the OSU Campus will leave your quads burning afterwards  Try it if you dare!
overview: <p>I've detailed what I believe to be the hardest afternoon ride possible within the MacDunn Forest next to Oregon State University.  With over 20,000 students at OSU now its a good bet that there are some hard core mountain bikers out there... are you one of them?  Do you think you can handle this 3-peak quad burner route.  I've got multiple guides for riding in this area that you can explore but this one combines 6 of them into a monster of a ride.  Good Luck and make sure to follow my detailed turn directions! </p>
tips: <p>Start at the center of campus on the Memorial Quad.  </p>
