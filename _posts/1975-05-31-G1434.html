sub_title: Via PCT and South Ridge
overview: <p>This is an advanced mountaineering climb with vertical walls at the top and very poor rock.  You absolutely MUST have rock climbing and mountaineering skills and the relative gear to make this ascent.  From the parking, follow the PCT to nearly the western face of the mountain.  Look for a cairn marking the climbers route and follow it up to the summit pinnacles where you will need to clip into bolts in the rock.  You and your partner will belay each other for the rest of the trip and most likely rappel down from the summit which is a very narrow ridge only about a foot wide with over thousand foot drops on either side.  If you have any fear of heights whatsoever do not attempt this climb.  Again, you must have prior experience leading climbs to attempt this. </p>
tips: <p>Start at the parking lot opposite of the Hoodoo road off of Route 20 in Santiam Pass.  A Northwest Forest Pass is required for this parking lot. </p>
