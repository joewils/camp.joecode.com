title: Squak Mountain Connector Trail
seo_title: squak-mountain-connector-trail
sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.
overview: <p>Often when hiking on this trail I find myself alone. Not because the trail is not worth hiking but because it is not well known. If you are hiking on the Southside of Cougar Mountain many hikers opt to start out from the paved parking area located a few hundred feet west, to make their trek to the mountain peak via the Wilderness Creek Trail. You can access this trail from the main parking area; however, there is a small dirt pull out conveniently located at the trailhead that will provide direct access.</p><p>Hiking up from this trail provides the shortest route up the mountain to reach the summit. It also allows you to choose the Wilderness Creek Trail on your return trip allowing you to make a loop without having to hike the same trail on your decent.</p><p>The dirt pullout is also a great parking area if you are looking to hike both Cougar Mountain and Squak Mountain. The West Access Trail on Squak Mountain can be accessed by a small trail entrance across the road. It can be difficult to spot as the entrance does not appear to be maintained. Standing in the dirt pullout area you should see a large dirt clearing directly across the street, the trail entrance is located to the left of the business property. </p>
tips: |-
  <p>How to get here:</p><p>From I-90, take exit 15 and head south on Highway 900 for 3.3 miles. The trailhead marker will be on your right, see guide photo, there will be an asphalt driveway leading uphill and to the right. The parking area will hold about 15 cars but rarely is full. There is an additional parking area 100 meters east, it is a small dirt pullout that can fit 2-3 cars and gives you direct access to the trail.</p><p>Connecting Trails:</p><p>Wilderness Creek Trail
