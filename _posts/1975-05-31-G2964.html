sub_title: A great hike past waterfalls to an overook above the Columbia Gorge.
overview: <p>This hike will take you past lower 150 foot Coopey Falls, Upper Coopey Falls which you can walk below, and up many switchbacks to a beautiful view over the Columbia River below.  There is also a really cool ridge of lava rock at the top that you can walk along for different views back towards the Angel's Rest Viewpoint.  This can be done any season but be warned that the trail can become very icy in the winter. </p>
tips: |-
  <p>Directions to trailhead:
  From Portland on I-84 take the Bridal Veil Exit 28.  The trailhead is just south on the Historic Columbia River Highway opposite the junction wit the interstate access road from Bridal Veil. </p>
