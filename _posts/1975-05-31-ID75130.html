Be prepared to cook meals on the wood stove if the power is out. Firewood is provided, though it may need to be split.</p><p>A table and chairs and additional seating is provided, along with candles, an oil lamp and a wooden rack for drying clothes. The water system is turned off during the winter season so the indoor flush toilet and running water are not available. A vault toilet is located behind the station.</p>
