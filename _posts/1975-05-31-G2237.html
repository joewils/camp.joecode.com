seo_title: wallace-falls-hike
sub_title: Beautiful, well-groomed trail up to a beutifull series of waterfalls
overview: <p>Wallace Falls is set of nine different cataracts in all which are well worth the hike up.  The hike is short enough for a day time picnic outing.  But, be prepared to get a little exercise as it is a 1200 foot elevation gain up to the falls.  On the trail, you'll find many examples of Cascade regional flora and fauna as well as some old growth forest.  The trailhead is easy to find with public bathrooms and drinking water available.  The path and well marked with bridges and nicely railed vista platforms to view the falls.  There is also a covered picnic area when you reach the bottom falls.  If it weren't for the elevation gain, I would recommend this hike for all children.  However, I'd only take kids that are over 4 years old or very athletic.  A lot of people stop at the picnic area to turn around and go back.  However, if you hike the next mile, you'll get to see all of the upper falls which are quite beautiful.  The one problem with this trail is that it is very popular and you will encouter others along the way. </p>
tips: <p>You should wear sturdy shoes although sneakers and tennis shoes should work fine.  Bring a water bottle to fill up at the trailhead as there is no drinking water available along the trail.  If you bring your dog, it must be on a leash.  This trail is definitely camera-friendly.  Don't bother with a swimsuit for the creek or falls as this is not encouraged or safe.  It's best to leave for the hike with plenty of time to get back before it is dark. </p>
