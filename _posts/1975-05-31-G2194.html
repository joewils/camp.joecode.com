sub_title: 'Hike to the highest point of the Columbia Gorge with amazing views of Mt Hood, Mt St Helens and Mt Adams '
overview: <p>Many consider this hike Oregon's hardest trail, and in fact the Starvation Ridge portion is used to train for the Mt. Hood Summit.</p><p>If you take the easier way up you will pass by a few waterfalls before you start a difficult climb to the top.</p><p>As you climb this six million year old shield volcano you will find breathtaking views of the Columbia Gorge, Mt. Adams, Mt. St Helens.</p><p>While the top is marred by a bunch of communication equipment you will still find one of the best views of Mt Hood. </p>
tips: '<p>To get to the trailhead from Portland drive I-84 east of Cascade Locks 10 miles to the Starvation Creek exit near milepost 54.  If you are coming from the west on I-84, you''ll have to take the Wyeth exit #51, turn around and drive back east to exit 54. </p><p>Make sure you are prepared with LOTS of water.  This is a very difficult and steep hike.</p><p>The lower portion of the hike is in dense forest and the upper portion has exposure to the sun.  So make sure you are prepared for both shade and sun. </p>'
