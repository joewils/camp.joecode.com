note: ''
orientationDescription: <p>Paulina Lake is located within the collapsed crater, or &amp;quot;caldera&amp;quot; of Newberry Volcano.  Nearly five miles in diameter, this caldera encircles the basins of Paulina Lake, and its twin, East Lake.</p><p>Neither lake receives water from an inlet stream, but instead, rely on rain, snowmelt and hot springs for water.  Paulina Creek drains the lake and has chiseled a narrow gorge through the caldera&amp;#39;s west wall creating a remarkable twin waterfall. Thermal vents and hot springs along the lake&amp;#39;s northeast edge help create a highly productive ecosystem.</p><p>Wetlands, diverse forests, and rocky slopes near the campground provide a necessary habitat for shorebirds, porcupine, deer, bats and the occasional black bear.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The unique location of Paulina Lake Campground offers visitors opportunities to hike shoreline trails and alpine vistas.</p><p>Visitors can also take advantage of time on the lake, boating, kayaking, swimming and fishing.   For anglers, this lake offers fantastic fishing opportunities. Spanning a surface area of 1,531 acres, the lake supports rainbow trout, brown trout and Kokanee salmon.</p><p>In September, the outlet of Paulina Lake may be choked with Kokanee moving to spawn in Paulina Creek.</p>
