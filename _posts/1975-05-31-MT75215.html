description: <p>May Creek Cabin is located on the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail in western Montana. It was built by miners in the early 1900s and used by them for  about 30 years. Hunters occupied it for about 30 years after that. The cabin went unused for nearly 30 years and was restored for public use in 1993. In 2011, more work was completed to enhance the quality and safety of the structure.</p><p> Summer and  fall months give visitors plenty of daylight and moderate temperatures to explore the surrounding meadows, peaks and valleys, as well as fish in plentiful mountain  streams.</p><p>The cabin can be accessed by driving to May Creek Campground and then hiking or skiing just over two miles, depending on conditions. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.</p>
drivingDirection: <p>From Wisdom, travel west on Highway 43 for about 16 miles to the May Creek Campground. Guests can park in the plowed parking area near the highway at the entrance to the campground during the winter. During the summer months, follow the campground road to the fence at the south end of the campground. Parking is available in the meadow just west of the campground.   From the campground, hike, ski south along the marked May Creek Trail, crossing a small bridge. About a quarter-mile past the bridge, the May Creek Trail intersects with the May Creek Ridge Trail; stay on the May Creek Trail and continue south for about two miles. The cabin is located on the edge of a large meadow, in the trees, on the east side of the creek. Large, blue diamond stakes mark the trail across the meadow to the cabin.  Maps  of the area may be purchased by calling the Wisdom Ranger District.</p>
facilitiesDescription: <p>The wood-frame, one-room cabin is equipped with bunk beds and foam mattresses that sleep up to four people, a wood-burning stove for heat and a propane stove for  cooking. The flat-topped wood stove can also be used for cooking. A table with benches, cooking and eating utensils, axe, shovel, bucket, cleaning gear and firewood (during the winter months) are  also provided.</p><p>An outhouse with a vault toilet is near the cabin. A propane lantern should also be available, but fuel is not supplied.</p><p>The cabin has no electricity or running water. It is recommended that guests bring their own water supply for drinking, cooking and washing. Water is also available  from a nearby creek, but it must be treated or boiled prior to use.</p><p>Guests should bring their own bedding, food, toilet paper, towels, flashlights, garbage bags and 16-ounce propane canisters for the stove and lantern. All garbage and  food must be packed out and guests should clean the cabin prior to leaving.</p>
