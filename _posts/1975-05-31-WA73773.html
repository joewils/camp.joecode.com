note: ''
orientationDescription: <p>Hemmed in by several designated wilderness areas, the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest showcases rugged peaks, sparkling alpine lakes and old-growth forests.</p><p>Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the area, dominates the landscape on a clear day. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, the active volcano from which the forest takes its name is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.</p><p>Flowing adjacent to this campground is the Cascade River, a tributary of the Skagit River, designated as a National Scenic River.</p><p>Wildlife in the area include mountain goats, coyotes, pine marten and a variety of migratory birds and native fish.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>In addition to being a prime location for hiking, fishing, picnicking and horseback riding in summer and early fall, Marble Creek offers excellent skiing and snowshoeing in the winter months.</p><p>The area surrounding the campground can accommodate anyone from the novice hiker to the most experienced outdoor enthusiast.</p><p>Several trailheads for the overnight backpacker are located in the vicinity of the nearby town of Marblemount, including Hidden Lake Trail. Beginning in a forested setting, the trail climbs quickly to open meadows and grand views of the Cascade River. As it reaches higher elevations, it winds through angular slabs of granite and groupings of alpine fir. Hidden Lake and the Hidden Lake Lookout can be seen below from the pass.</p>
