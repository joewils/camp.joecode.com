sub_title: A short walk through a lava field that has left behind impressions of old trees.
overview: <p>This is a cool little trail that takes you through a lava flow.&nbsp; As the lava flowed around trees it left casts/holes of where the tree was.&nbsp;</p><p>Formed approximately 7,000 years ago when hot molten lava flowed from the nearby Newberry Volcano, the landscape holds lava casts of the ancient trees that were growing there at the time. Over the years, Ponderosa pine, penstemon flowers, and Indian paintbrush have flourished in the rocky terrain adding life and beautiful splashes of color to the landscape.</p><p> </p>
