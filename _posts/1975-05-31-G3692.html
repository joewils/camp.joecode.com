sub_title: Hike to the top of this coastal peak for terrific views over the Paciific.
overview: <p>This tall peak on the northern Oregon coast has a great views out over the pacific from a viewpoint at the top.  I climbed this from the northern trailhead and returned the same route but I will suggest what EveryTrail user &quot;SeasideChamber&quot; did in his trip which was to drop a bike off at the southern end of the trail and then drive to the northern trailhead.  By doing so you will be able to grab your bike at the south end after your traverse over Neahkahnie and can bike back up Route 101 to your car again.  Make sure to read the wikipedia page attached to this guide to read about the treasure on the mountain.... </p>
tips: <p>Both Trailheads can be found just a few miles north of the town of Manzanita on Rte 101 of the northern Oregon Coast.  You will need a Northwest Forest Pass to park here for the day. </p>
