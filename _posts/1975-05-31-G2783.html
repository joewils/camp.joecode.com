title: Lower Dan's Trail Mountain Biking

sub_title: A fun figure-8 mountain biking loop below Dimple Hill just north of Corvallis, OR
overview: <p>This is a fun loop to do after you get out of work if you live in Corvallis as it can be done in about an hour if you are in good shape.  You will also have the option if you have more time and energy to continue on Dan's trail to the top of Dimple Hill.  Please refer to my Dimple Hill guide if you chose to do that and then link it up with this guide to get back to 29th street.  I like this route because the trailhead at the end of 29th street is easier to access if you ride your bike to it from town than driving all the way out and around to the Chip Ross Park lot.   </p>
tips: |-
  <p>Directions:
  From Walnut Blvd in North Corvallis, OR head north on 29th street and follow the road up the hill to where it ends.  Park anywhere on the side of the road but be curteous as there are properties up there.  Don't block driveways, etc.   </p>
