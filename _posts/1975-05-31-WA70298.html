orientationDescription: <p>Hemmed in by several designated wilderness areas, the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest showcases rugged peaks, sparkling   alpine lakes and old-growth forests.</p><p>Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area, dominates the landscape on a clear day. Rising to an   elevation of 10,781 feet, the active volcano from which the forest takes its name is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an   extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a   massive volcanic crater.</p><p>Wildlife in the area include mountain goats, coyotes, pine marten and a variety of migratory birds and native fish.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>In addition to being a prime location for hiking, and fishing in summer and early fall, Money Creek offers excellent skiing and   snowshoeing in the winter months.</p><p>The Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest&amp;#39;s 1,500 miles of trails can entice any hiker to get outdoors. From smooth paths   meandering through deep quiet forests to challenging ascents up boulder-studded mountains, opportunities abound for every skill   level.</p><p>Nearby Barclay Creek Trail is an easier hike that follows Barclay Creek through diverse forest until reaching Barclay Lake at an   elevation of 2,422 feet. Along the trail, hikers will encounter old growth trees, deer ferns, trillium, wood violets, bleeding   hearts and salmon berries in season. Cedar boardwalks lead to a log bridge that crosses Barclay Creek. Once over the bridge,   visitors will arrive at the lake and can take in an outstanding view of the north wall of Baring Mountain, dramatically rising   3,700 feet above the lake.</p>
