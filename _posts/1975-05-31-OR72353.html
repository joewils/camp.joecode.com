description: <p>The Tilly Jane A-Frame is an ideal getaway for individuals, groups and families who enjoy the great outdoors in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.  The facility is one of the oldest structures on Mt. Hood and is a popular cabin used by winter recreationists.  Peak season for use of the cabin is usually December through March.  It provides access to scenic terrain, specifically hiking, snowshoeing and backcountry skiing activities.</p><p>During the summer months the A-Frame is easily accessed by taking a short quarter mile walk through the Tilly Jane Campground.  During the winter months, it serves as a winter retreat for persons hardy enough to make the effort to get to the cabin from the Tilly Jane Sno-Park.  Winter conditions often exist for nine months of the year.  Visitors can ski to the cabin following a 9 mile gently sloping road or climb the historic Tilly Jane ski trail which is roughly 2.7 miles, with an elevation gain of 1,900 feet.  Skis or snowshoes are highly recommended!</p><p>Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety.  Backcountry travel experience is highly recommended.</p>
drivingDirection: '<p>From Hood River, OR &amp;ndash; South on Hwy 35 for 8.5 miles, past the Hood River Ranger Station.  Look for the Cooper Spur Inn sign and turn right off Hwy 35 (just North of Olallie trailhead).  Drive Forest Road 3512,  to Cooper Spur Inn.  Turn left onto the Cloud Cap/Tilly Jane Road #3512.  The first trailhead is just past the intersection with Cooper Spur ski area, with parking on the right and the trail head on the left side of the road.  This is the trailhead used for winter travel.  Cloud Cap/Tilly Jane Road #3512 is gated/locked and not plowed in winter.  In summer months, continue up the long winding Road #3512, veering left onto Road 630 near the top.  Taking a right will lead you to the Cloud Cap and Snowshoe hut structures.  Park at the Tilly Jane Campground (NW Forest Pass required or parking permits available on site) and take the Tilly Jane Trail, 600B, a quarter mile to its intersection with the Tilly Jane A-Frame.</p>'
facilitiesDescription: <p>The 24-by-48, two story structure has a sleeping loft, accessed by a ladder that can accommodate up to 20 people.  More than one group may reserve the facility at the same time.  It is equipped with two picnic tables, benches, a few chairs and a wood stove for heating and boiling/melting snow.</p><p>In warmer months, water can be found with a short walk to Tilly Creek.  We advise that all water be treated or boiled.  In winter, water can be obtained by digging an access hole to Tilly Creek or by melting snow using the pots provided at the cabin.  A primitive outhouse with a pit toilet is provided within the alcove of the structure.  You will need to bring your own toilet paper.</p><p>Guests will also need to provide sleeping bags and pads, warm clothing, headlamps, cooking pots/pans, stove and fuel, matches or a lighter.  It is best to treat your stay as a backpacking trip, bringing everything you&amp;rsquo;d need minus a tent.  Several lanterns and replacement mantels are available.  You will need to provide the one pound green propane canisters if you wish to use the lanterns.  Firewood and splitting tools are provided.</p>
