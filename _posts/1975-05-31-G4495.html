sub_title: 'This guide connects popular together for an all encompassing loop of the various environments with the wildlife refuge '
overview: <p>In this mega loop of the William L. Finley National Wildlife Refuge I have strung together 5 different popular trails to make one massive loop that will take you through all the different environments the refuge has to offer.  You'll climb hills, circle around ponds and marshes and finish with an amazing brand new boardwalk.  Along the way you will find benches to rest at and several wildlife viewing blinds where you can watch for various bird species such as waterfowl, herons, hawks, ospreys, eagles and songbirds.  Make sure you bring a good pair of hiking shoes (ones that are waterproof preferrably for the cattail lake loop), binoculars and a good zoom lens. </p>
tips: '<p>From Corvallis Follow Hwy 99 south for about 8.5 miles from Avery Ave until you see the Refuge Road on the right. Take that road and drive a few miles down the gravel road past the headquarters. You''ll drive across open meadows up on a hill. At the bottom of the hill you will see a sign for the trail. I''ve included a photo of the sign marking the trailhead at POI #1 </p>'
