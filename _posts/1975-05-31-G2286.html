overview: <p>This hike is short and very easy to a great looking waterfall.  There are signs along the way that tell the story of the Sweet Family who homesteaded this area.  </p><p>This is a great hike to pair with the nearby Sweet Creek Falls. </p>
tips: <p>Highway 126 to Siuslaw River Bridge in Mapleton (15 miles east of Florence or 46 miles west of Eugene). Cross the bridge from town and make immediate turn west on Sweet Creek Road.
