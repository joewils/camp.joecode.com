importantInformation: <p> Water is not available at the campground. Off-road vehicle use is prohibited within the campground. In accordance with standard industry practices, Sierra Recreation will be assessing a $8.00 additional vehicle fee on the &amp;quot;Second Vehicle&amp;quot; in each single family campsite, and on the &amp;ldquo;Third and Fourth Vehicle&amp;rdquo; in any double family campsite, provided these vehicles are not joined to the first vehicle by a hitch and towed onto the site. In the case of motorcycles, the first two are considered as one vehicle for determining additional vehicle fees. The third and fourth motorcycle would also be considered as one vehicle. No additional vehicle fees are collected for bicycles. Click here for more information on Mt. Hood National Forest. The campground is managed by Mount Hood Recreation; comment forms and more information are available from campground hosts or by clicking here Due to the spread of invasive insects, firewood from outside the area is not permitted.

orientationDescription: <p>The campground is located southeast of the city of Estacada, on the Collawash River at an elevation of about 1,500 feet. It lies in a dense forest of old-growth Douglas fir trees and plentiful rhododendron bushes that provide privacy between campsites.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Catch and release fishing for trout is allowed on the main fork of the Collawash, but the streams are closed to fishing for salmon and steelhead. Whitewater rafting and kayaking are popular activities. At least one 5-mile stretch of the more than 17-mile river boasts class III-IV whitewater.</p><p>The Collawash flows into the nearby Clackamas River, which also provides miles of wild water as it snakes through the scenic Cascade Range. Anglers enjoy fishing the Clackamas for steelhead, Kokanee and Chinook salmon. The river provides a perfect habitat for the federally protected bald eagle and northern spotted owl, as well as an occasional peregrine falcon. A variety of other wildlife makes its home in the area.</p><p>Visitors enjoy hiking in the Bull of the Woods Wilderness, which is south of the campground. Several primitive forest roads nearby are open to mountain biking.</p><p> West Cascades Scenic Byway runs just outside the campground, meandering along the Wild and Scenic Clackamas River.</p>
