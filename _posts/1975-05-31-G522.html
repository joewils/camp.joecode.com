sub_title: 'Bubbling mud pots, sulfur vents and boiling pools make this trip to hell and back well worth the effort. '
overview: "<p>Located four hours north east of San Francisco this Northern California park might be a little out of the way, but it&rsquo;s a prime destination for seekers of tranquility and those with even just a passing interest in geology.</p><p>Sticking to the trail is always recommended, but if you're visiting Bumpass Hell we really must insist. To illustrate the point you have to look no further than the man who discovered these volcanic hotsprings, Kendal Bumpass, who managed to fall in and injure his leg not once but twice, the second time requiring his leg to be amputated!</p><p>Scare-stories aside, this really is an easy family friendly hike with little in the way of danger as long as you keep the little ones under control.</p><p>Elevation gain: \n&bull; 450ft (from 8,100 - 8,400ft)</p><p>Tips:\n&bull; Summer through fall is the best time to experience this trail. Snow covers the Lassen landscape for much of the year, closing roads and obscuring trails. See our links below to National Park Service information on road and trail closures.\n&bull; Combine this hike with the 5-mile trek to the summit of nearby Lassen Peak for a great day out. </p>"
