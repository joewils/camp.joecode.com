description: <p>A spectacular saltwater beach park located along the shores of picturesque Port Susan. From its 3,300 foot shoreline to its evergreen forests, Kayak Point Park offers a rich setting for pier fishing, windsurfing, picnicking, hiking, camping, and boat launching. A pier extends 300 feet into Puget Sound and is the site for crabbing and fishing. At high tide, the water depth is 50 feet off the pier&amp;#39;s end. Baited crab pots are used to attract Dungeness and red rock crab.  Fishing enthusiasts catch flounder, sole, true cod, rockfish, and walleye Pollack year-round and migrating sea perch in Spring and Summer. Casting from the shoreline will occasionally bring in dolly varden or a sea-run cutthroat. A  single lane boat launch provides access to Port Susan.   The park is located on beautiful Puget Sound with views of Whidbey Island and Camano Island.</p>
