importantInformation: <p> In accordance with standard industry practices, Mount Hood Recreation will be assessing a $8 additional vehicle fee on the &apos;second vehicle&apos; in each single family campsite, and on the &apos;third and fourth vehicle&apos; in any double family campsite, provided these vehicles are not joined to the first vehicle by a hitch and towed onto the site. In the case of motorcycles, the first two are considered as one vehicle for determining additional vehicle fees. The third and fourth motorcycle would also be considered as one vehicle. No additional vehicle fees are collected for bicycles. Off-road vehicle use is prohibited within the campground Click here for more information on Mt. Hood National Forest The campground is managed by Mount Hood Recreation, a division of Northwest Land Management. Comment forms and more information are available from campground hosts or on our website . Due to the spread of invasive insects, firewood from outside the area is not permitted.
