overview: <p>This trail gives epic view of the Columbia River gorge as well as Mount Hood. You start with favorite mountain biking spot for locals and continue thru both public and private land. Between April and October, you might encounter cows at the mid section. No worries, they are nice, but you can not bring your dog between April and October. Even on rainy days the first half of the trail will be fine to hike, and if it is really coming down, just go until you hit the cow grazing area and turn back. </p>
tips: |-
  <p>This is a bit over 7 miles, so if you want to just go one way, take two cars and park one at Skyline Hospital, the trail ends in the hospital parking lot.</p><p>There is poison oak about, so stay on the trail.
  The waterfall is fine to let pups drink from, I have drunk from it.  :) </p>
