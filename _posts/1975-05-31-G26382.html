sub_title: A quick loop guide to getting the most out of this small park.
overview: <p>At the far south/west point of West Vancouver along Marine Drive is the Lighthouse Park.  A small(ish) park it gives a great representation of the west coast flora and terrain.  If you are interested in hiking anywhere on the coast, I highly recommend starting here.</p><p>While the core of the park would be considered easy terrain, the outer loop trails represented by this guide should be considered moderate and you should definitely be equipped for the terrain.</p><p>A great hike, this back and forth loopy walk will take you through most areas of the park and show you all the major view points and highlights.  Official trail maps can be found at the information kiosks in the parking lots or downloaded from the City of West Vancouver website. </p>
tips: <p>Good hiking shoes for the outer loops.  Expect significant elevation changes, rocky paths with many snags to catch your toes.  Watch for slippery terrain in wet conditions.</p><p>Great views of the area, rocky beaches, outcrops and a bit of history for those who take the time to explore around the light station.</p><p>The drive along Marine Drive is worth making even if you don't stop in for a hike. </p>
