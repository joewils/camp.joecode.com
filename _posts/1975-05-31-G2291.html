sub_title: 'Hiking a lollipop-loop trail on the base of Mt. Hood from Sandy River to gorgeous Ramona Falls and back. '
overview: <p>Ramona Falls drops 120 feet, cascading and splitting into ever smaller fingers of water broken up by the hexagonal columns of basalt at the base of the cliff.  The trail is relatively easy for this region, but the 1100 feet of elevation gain could require plenty of rest stops for those not used to hiking in the mountains.</p><p>Speed hikers could probably finish the trail in about 2.5 hours, but you&rsquo;ll want to spend some time at the falls and enjoy scenery along the way, so plan 4-6 hours.</p><p>The south leg of the loop to the falls is less scenic and bogs down with sand in a few spots, but it&rsquo;s still an enjoyable, well maintained trail with some nice views on the way to the falls.  After the falls, the return trip on the north leg is wonderful, following the lush, green path of Ramona Creek and skirting towering cliffs before veering south to head back towards the trailhead. </p>
tips: |-
  <p>A critical, temporary bridge early in the trail is removed each winter, so don't try this hike during winter.</p><p>Be sure to get a National Forest Recreation Pass ($5.00) or one of the various annual passes that cover the area.  Find pass details at the Forest Service website (linked down and to the right under &quot;Other Resources&quot;) or contact the Mt. Hood National Forest Headquarters (about 22 miles west of the trailhead):</p><p>16400 Champion Way
