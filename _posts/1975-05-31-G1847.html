seo_title: marshalls-hill-trail
sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.
overview: <p>Located far from the park entrance you will have this trail to yourself. Rarely have I seen other hikers on this remote trail but that doesn't mean that there is nothing to be seen. You can easily spot small animals on this trail due to the infrequent use.</p><p>You will begin the trail by leaving either the Wildside or Red Town Trail. The trail starts off with a slight elevation gain and a few switchbacks, depending on the season you may also hear frogs near by. After a short incline the trail levels off and for the remainder of the trail stays fairly level. Moving along the trail you will feel alone deep in the forest but there are many new subdivisions that have been built along the edge of the park. The only time many of the houses are visible will be in the late fall and winter times when most of the foliage has retreated. As you head down the trail make sure to follow the larger dirt hiking trails. There are many unofficial trails that lead into the backyards of the new subdivisions; it will be easy to spot which the difference in trails. The only questionable fork in the trail is near the end. You will come to a large stump, about 7 feet tall and just as round, with a Marshall's Hill Trail marker in front of it. Stay to your left as the other path will lead you a long way down East Cross Town Trail towards the city of Newcastle. It will be easy to tell if you took the wrong trail, you should see a sign indicating the start of the Cougar Mountain Trail system about 100 yards down the trail. After making a right on the trail you are near the end, you will come to a short uphill climb followed by a paved road. The paved road is the end to the Marshall's Hill Trail and the start of the De Leo Wall Trail.</p><p>I would suggest continuing on the De Leo Wall trail as it is roughly the same distance back. There is a great look out point where you can see the city of Renton and on a clear day Mt. Rainier along the De Leo Wall Trail. </p>
tips: "<p>How to get here: </p><p>From I-90 East take Exit 13 and make a right at the stop sign. Continue to follow Lakemont Blvd SE and the Red Town Trailhead parking lot will be on the left, about 3 miles away. The parking area holds 25-30 cars and has additional parking is to the left of the entrance. </p><p>The quickest way to get to this trailhead is from the Red Town parking area. From the parking area you will see an information kiosk and a dirt path. There are three options at the fork in the trailhead. Follow the trail marker and head down to the Wildside Trail.</p><p>Connecting Trails:</p><p>-Wildside Trail\n-Indian Trail\n-De Leo Wall Trail</p><p>Park Hours:</p><p>The park is open year around from 8:00AM to Dusk </p><p>Amenities:</p><p>-There is no drinkable water located on the trail.
