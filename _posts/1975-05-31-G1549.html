title: Rainbow Town Trail
seo_title: rainbow-town-trail
sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.
overview: <p>This is one of my favorite short hikes in the park. It is an easy stroll and round trip is only 1 mile long, depending on which route you take. On this trail you will see many artifacts from the mining days of the area and information on the mining activities.</p><p>The best way to get to the Rainbow Town Trail is to hike in from the Wildside Trail. From the Red Town parking area take the Wildside Trail and in .1 miles you will see the trailhead marker for Rainbow Town.  The trail is fairly level to get here but you will have to cross two small creeks for which bridges have been built. For this section of the park, I would advise you bringing an extra pair of shoes if it has been raining since this trail has a few spots that can have deep muddy puddles.</p><p>On the trail you can see a mining cart full with coal from the mines below.  Across from the mining cart you can see the sealed passage to the ford mine shaft. While you cannot go into the mine you can read about the mine on the information kiosk in from of the mine. </p><p>If you are hiking these trails to learn more about the areas coal mining history I would suggest hiking this trail in addition with; Rainbow Town Trail, Steam Hoist Trail, Red Creek Trail, and the Coal Creek Trails.  Together these trails will provide you with a relatively easy hike that can be completed by nearly everyone. </p>
