description: <p>This lookout is perched atop Fairview Peak at an elevation of 5,933 feet, offering visitors a unique lodging experience in Umpqua National Forest in southwest Oregon.</p><p>The Fairview Peak site was historically occupied as a fire lookout since the 1920s. During the late 50s and early 60s the tower was used as an Air Force &amp;quot;gap filler&amp;quot; radar station. Having a range of around 65 miles, these radars were placed in areas where it was thought enemy aircraft could fly low to avoid detection by the lower-range radars of the permanent and mobile radar networks.</p><p>  The lookout tower is available for reservations from mid-June or early July through mid-October, and typically unavailable during peak fire season, usually the months of August and September, when it is in use for fire administration. High-clearance vehicles are recommended for travel to this site, and guests must bring several of their own amenities.</p>
drivingDirection: <p>During June and October, there may be inclement weather conditions such as snow and ice that can make accessing the lookout more dangerous. Guests may have to snowshoe, cross-country ski or snowmobile 5 miles to the site in winter.  Entry to the road and tower is secured with combination locks. The combination will be provided in your reservation confirmation letter. You may also contact the Cottage Grove Ranger Station for the combinations and other area information by calling (541) 767-5000 Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Please note that the ranger station is unable to provide assistance during weekends and holidays, so please plan ahead for a safe experience.  Access is via single lane, graveled roads located on steep hillsides. The last few miles are narrow and rocky and high-clearance vehicles are strongly recommended. Proceed slowly and deliberately, using low gear.  From Oregon Interstate 5, take Cottage Grove exit 174 onto Row River Road 2400. Continue east for 19 miles to Brice Creek Road 2470. Keep right and continue on Brice Creek Road for 12 miles to Noonday Road 2212. Turn right and travel 8.8 miles. At Champion Saddle, stay to your left, traveling on Sharps Creek Road 2460 for 1.1 miles to Fairview Lookout Road, 2460-773. Turn right on this road, pass through the gate and follow for 1.2 miles to the lookout.</p>
facilitiesDescription: <p>The lookout cabin is a 15 x 15 room, set 53 feet above the ground. It is furnished with a full-size futon and twin bunks with mattresses. Inside amenities include a table with chairs, a propane heater, cook stove and oven and small refrigerator. Outside, a picnic table, campfire ring and vault toilet are provided.
