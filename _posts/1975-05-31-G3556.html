seo_title: saddle-mountain-oregon-coast-peak
sub_title: 'A rewarding ascent of this peak in good weather provides views of Mt Hood, St Helens &amp; Rainier from the coast. '
overview: <p>The trail starts at an easy pace and begins zig-zaging after about 1 mile. The trail gets progressively steeper and more arduous as it gains height. Just before the saddle it levels out prior to a descent between the two peaks. A steeper trail then takes you to the summit. On the steepest parts the trail is covered with wire to provide a good footing and reduce erosion. </p>
tips: <p>The Saddle Mountain State Park entrance is located just past mile post 10 going East on Hwy 26 from Seaside. The trail head is 7 mile from the entrance to the park. The road is very bumpy so be kind to your vehicle suspension! There is a restroom at the trailhead. DO NOT attempt this hike without adequate footwear, sufficient water and warm clothing for the summit. DO NOT stray from the trail, climb outcrops or carry out any other dangerous activities. The person writing this guide volunteers for a high-angle rescue team and has plenty of rescues on this peak due to careless behavior! If you are taking young ones then make sure that there are TWO adults in the party! </p>
