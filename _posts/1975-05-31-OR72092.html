Thermal vents and hot springs along the lake&amp;#39;s northeast edge help create a highly productive ecosystem.</p><p>The surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests support a variety of wildlife, including black bear, bighorn sheep, deer, native fish and migratory birds.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Visitors can take advantage of boating, kayaking, swimming and fishing on East Lake. A boat ramp is located in the campground, and the lake has a 10 mph speed limit.</p><p>For anglers, the lake provides the perfect setting to fish from boat or the shoreline. It supports rainbow trout, brown trout and Kokanee salmon. In September, the outlet of adjacent Paulina Lake may be choked with Kokanee moving to spawn in Paulina Creek.</p><p>The Crater Rim Trail, considered one of the finest high country trails in the area, boasts vast stretches of forest, deserts and mountains. The trail has many access points and connectors to other trails.</p>
