sub_title: A beautiful 4 mile stretch of Oregon Coast with plenty of seals to see up close.
overview: <p>This hike is a beautiful coastal walk along a four-mile strip of Oregon coastline.  This amazing hike starts in beautiful Sunset Bay, takes you through beautiful gardens in Shore Acres State Park, stops at a sea lion viewpoint off a road and ends with a closeup view of sea lions at Cape Arago.  The return trip takes you a slightly different way for different coastal views past amazing rock formations.  It is an easy afternoon and you should definitely bring a camera! </p>
tips: <p>The GPS route that I took for this trip takes you through the woods for the most part on a nice trail through various vegetation with occasional stops at the coast for views.  I like taking this trail on the way out and returning via the more coastline route on the way back.  If you time it right it would be a great walk back late in the afternoon with the setting sun. </p>
