description: <p>Clearwater Lookout Cabin is a single story, wood frame structure constructed in 1935. It is tucked at the base of the Clearwater Lookout tower, a 94-foot steel tower constructed by the Civil Conservation Corps in 1933. Through the years, the tower has been used as a landmark by the public and employees of the Forest Service. The tower is no longer manned during fire season, but it is used on occasion during extreme fire conditions. The tower is closed to public access, but the rental cabin is open year-round.</p><p>The cabin is located about 25 miles south of Pomeroy, Washington in the Umatilla National Forest. Access by car is from June 1 to November 1. In winter, access is limited to cross country skis, snowshoes or snowmobile.</p>
