sub_title: 10.9 mile trail near Irvine County, California
overview: <p>Limestone Canyon is about 10.9 miles long and located near Irvine County, California. The trail is great for hiking and normally takes a full day.</p><p>Limestone Canyon is not open to the public, except for special days. &nbsp;This was one of them.We accessed it off of E Santiago Canyon Rd, just past Trabuco Canyon (coming from coast). &nbsp;The Augustine Staging area was the designated &quot;register&quot; site. &nbsp;You will see a photo of the maps they posted in the staging area, identifying routes as easy, moderate or strenuous. &nbsp;Ours was moderately strenuous for recreational hikers.From there, we set out on what we thought was going to be 13 miles, but ended up being 11 (if EveryTrail's tracking is correct). &nbsp;I do think it was closer to &nbsp;12-13 miles, as EveryTrail shows us making a straight line back to base, and ignores our mileage on the ridge. &nbsp;And in general, we walk 3 mph, and hike at about 2.5 mph, so that would put us at 12.5 miles ( 2.5 x 5). &nbsp;So call it 12 miles to be safe.We set out on the new ShoeString Trail, which unfortunately runs parallel to Santiago Canyon Rd. &nbsp;But after about 2 miles, it puts you on track to go inward, away from traffic, and this was quite nice. &nbsp;There were some steep hills, and we passed several bikers and walkers who had stopped to rest. &nbsp;So it is do-able regardless of your level, just pace yourself.The highest elevation gains came at 4.7 miles, and again at 6.1 miles, both times reaching approximately 1700 feet. </p><p>We decided to do the outward Ridges, since that gave us the highest elevation gain and mileage (and the most challenge). &nbsp;There were quite a few uphills and downhills, so those with knee problems might want to bring trekking poles.The Raptors were nesting, and we did see some nests, as well as the rare white tailed kite. (he's in one of our photos, but we just use an iPhone, so he is a tiny spec).The EveryTrail tracking (red marking on map) did not quite &quot;jive&quot; with what we actually did (the straight red line on map was really a jagged line along one of the ridges, and photos didn't get assigned correct to their locations for several reasons), so here was our route:Shoestring t&gt; West Loma &gt;East Loma &gt; The Sinks &gt; Cactus Cyn &gt; Limestone Ridge &gt; the Raptor, (a cutover to Limestone Cyn to avoid 2nd half of Limestone Ridge which is loose rock and tricky) &gt; Augustine staging. &nbsp;I would say this was a strenuous hike, and you can see it in how long it took us, and we did not stop to rest. &nbsp;We did slow down in nesting area to observe, but never halted, and moved quickly on flat land.All in all, a beautiful hike with lots of vistas of Irvine Lake, Orange, and the surrounding areas. &nbsp;The wildflowers are all out now, and are just beautiful. </p>
tips: <p>I would rate our route as strenuous, but there are more moderate routes. &nbsp;Lots of steep elevation gains - be prepared. &nbsp;(be sure your toe nails are trimmed!). &nbsp;Take lots of water, and wear a hat. &nbsp;Rangers were on the trail by bike, foot, car and horse, to be assured no one needed assistance.  Great challenging hike. </p>
