In the case of motorcycles, the first two are considered as one vehicle for determining additional vehicle fees. The third and fourth motorcycle would also be considered as one vehicle. No additional vehicle fees are collected for bicycles. Off-road vehicle use is prohibited within the campground Click here for more information on the Mt.
