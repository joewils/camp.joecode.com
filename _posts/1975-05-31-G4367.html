sub_title: Easy trail through Channel Lake area of Elijah Bristow State Park with lots of nature viewing areas.
overview: <p>The Turtle Trail is an short easy hike along Channel Lake, which is more of a wetland then an actual lake.  Be on the look out for wildlife as you sit on the benches in the area.  Along the trail you will enter a forest where deer are known to hide out.  Finally you will walk along the Willamette River.</p><p>Elijah Bristow State Park is an 847-acre collage of meadows, wetlands, ponds and scattered woodlands along the south bank of the Middle Fork of the Willamette River. It is the centerpiece of a complex of parks on the river below and above Dexter Dam.</p><p>Mountain bike riders, horseback riders and hikers share nearly 12 miles of trails that lead to great fishing holes and quiet places for watching wildlife, such as deer, elk, beaver, great blue herons, hawks, bald eagles and coyotes. Professional botanists and student naturalists are lured by the park&rsquo;s diverse ecosystems, model restoration efforts and prime breeding grounds for the Western pond turtle. Seasonal salmon runs present added spectacles for sightseers and enticements for anglers. </p>
tips: <p>Take Hwy 58 East of Eugene for 9 miles and turn left on Wheeler Road. Turn right into the park and keep left at the junction. You will see the Channel Lake area on your left, just past the Lost Creek area.</p><p>Turtle Trail is for hikers only, horses and bikes are not allowed. </p>
