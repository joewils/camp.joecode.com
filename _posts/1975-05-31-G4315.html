sub_title: 'Beautiful and rather easy hike going up to eventually see a nice strong waterfall (during spring). '
overview: <p>A very nice hike into Waterfall Canyon. This is a pretty easy hike for the most part. I know that kids and such are able to make it up rather easily. As long as you go during the spring you'll get an awesome view of the waterfall at the end of the trail as well as a rather nice, albeit slim view of the city down below. </p>
tips: <p>There are numerous trail heads and places to park to get to Waterfall Canyon but we chose the 36th Street parking lot at the beginning of the Exercise Trail that runs along the golf course there. </p>
