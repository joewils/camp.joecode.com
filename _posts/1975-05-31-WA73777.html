orientationDescription: <p>Rugged peaks, scenic rivers and abundant wildlife define the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and surrounding designated wilderness areas. On a clear day visitors can see Mt. Baker, which rises to an elevation of 10,781 feet. The active volcano is perpetually snow-capped. Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.</p><p>Old-growth forests line the wide, gently-flowing South Fork Stillaguamish River, known for its salmon run. Chinook, Coho, chum, pink and sockeye salmon, steelhead trout, sea-run cutthroat and bull trout use the river and its tributaries for spawning.</p><p>Undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests provide important habitat for wildlife. Many species of mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles make their homes in the area, which also sustains rare species such as lynx, moose, wolves and wolverine.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest has 1,500 miles of trails. From smooth paths meandering through deep quiet forests to challenging ascents up a boulder-studded mountain, opportunities abound for every skill level.</p><p>The Mt. Dickerman Trail switchbacks steeply for 3.0 miles through a dark forest of timber to an alpine meadow that was replanted in 1915 after a major forest fire. From this point, the trail rises above timberline to an alpine meadow full of wildflowers in July and August.</p><p>The trail offers spectacular views in all directions as the trail climbs to the 5,723&amp;#39; summit.</p>
