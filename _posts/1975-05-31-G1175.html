sub_title: Climbing to the summit of the South Sister from Devil's Lake Trailhead.
overview: <p>The South Sister, also known as Charity, is Oregon's third highest mountain.  The hike to the top is very difficult, but fairly easy as far as climbing mountains can go, as there is indeed a trail that goes all the way to the top and can be done without any technical mountain climbing gear.</p><p>The hike can easily be done in a day, and usually takes between 7 and 10 hours round trip.  The hike to the top is about 6 and a quarter miles long (12 round trip) with a 4900 feet elevation gain.</p><p>The mountain itself is a volcano that is around 50,000 years old and last erupted 2000 years ago.</p><p>As you hike you will pass Moraine Lake, and the Lewis and Clark glaciers.  At the top of the South Sisters you will find Oregon's highest lake Teardrop Pool. </p>
tips: '<p>To get to the trailhead at Devils Lake take Cascade Lakes Highway #46 28.7 miles west from Bend.  It''s a little over 6 miles past Mt Bachelor Ski Area.</p><p>Make sure you bring lots of water.  On a cloudy day you will easily go through 2 quarts of water.  3-4 quarts are recommended on a hot day.  There are a few lakes along the route that you can fill up at if you have a filtration system.</p><p>Bring lots of food.  This is a grueling steep hike and you will need your energy.</p><p>The temperature can vary greatly from the trailhead to the summit.  Pay attention to the weather forecasts.  Even in August, if a cold front comes through it can get down into the 30''s at the top.  If so bring a jacket, hat and gloves.</p><p>Bring good hiking boots and think about gators to protect your shoes from filling up with the loose sand and rocks that are the bane of many hikers on South Sister.</p><p>Bring a good hiking stick, or hiking poles.  You''ll find it very useful both going up and coming down the steep trail.</p><p>Be smart, if there is a cloud at the top of the mountain there may be a blizzard inside.  Don''t take unnecessary risks.</p><p>Stay off Lewis glacier.  Untrained hikers have ventured out onto the glacier and fallen into crevices 40 feet down. </p>'
