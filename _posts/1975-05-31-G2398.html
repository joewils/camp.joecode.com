title: White Butte - North Dakota's Highpoint
seo_title: white-butte-north-dakotas-highpoint
sub_title: For those state peak baggers out there... here's a short fun one!
overview: <p>An extremely easy highpoint to nab, although getting there can be somewhat of a challenge.  Don't forget to leave a donation in the mailbox! (see below) </p>
tips: |-
  <p>Directions to the Trailhead:
  From Amidon, travel two miles east on Highway 85 and make a right onto an unmarked gravel road. Proceed five miles (mark your odometer) and make a right onto another unmarked dirt road. Continue 1.2 miles to what appears to be a residence. A large metal mailbox is on the left.  It is custom to leave a donation in this mailbox as you are traveling over their land. A tractor road begins at this mailbox and heads directly toward White Butte.  This road can be crazy rutty so it's your choice whether or not you want to drive to the actual trail or not.   </p>
