description: <p>Perched atop its namesake mountain at an elevation of 5,587 feet, Evergreen Mountain Lookout was built in 1935 for detecting wildfires. During fire season, lookouts stayed  in the cabin, watching for lightning strikes and forest fires in the Skykomish drainage. Once the lookout located a fire or smoke, he or she would radio to the  Skykomish Ranger Station and give local landmarks to help firefighters locate the fire quickly.</p><p>During World War II, Evergreen Mountain Lookout was used as an Aircraft Warning Station, and then remained an active fire tower until the early 1980s. During  volunteer restoration efforts in the 1990s, the lookout was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p><p>The lookout tower must be accessed via a steep, scenic hike on the  Evergreen Lookout Trail . Some amenities are provided, but guests should be prepared to pack in many of their own supplies.</p>
drivingDirection: '<p>From State Route 2, turn north onto Beckler River Road (Forest Road #65), which is 0.5 miles east of the town of Skykomish. Continue on Forest Road #65 for 13 miles to Jack Pass. At Jack Pass, turn right onto FSR #6550 and drive about 1 mile to FSR #6554. Drive FSR #6554 6.5 miles to the trailhead. It is another 1.5 mile hike to the lookout.</p>'
facilitiesDescription: <p>The 14x14-ft. lookout cabin sleeps four and is furnished with one twin-sized bed and mattress, three extra mattresses, a table and chairs, propane stove,  two propane lanterns, two cooking pots, dishes and a coffee pot.

orientationDescription: <p>On a clear day, guests at Evergreen Mountain Lookout see views of Glacier Peak, Mt. Daniels, Keyes Peak, Columbia Glacier, Mt. Rainier and parts of the Henry M. Jackson Wilderness.   Remains of the last big fire spotted on Evergreen Mountain in 1967 are still evident on the rocky south face of the ridge to within several hundred feet of  the lookout.</p><p>Evergreen Mountain Lookout is situated within the Wild Sky Wilderness area. Wildlife is abundant, and guests may catch a glimpse of black bears, bobcat, elk or bald eagle. Wolves are making a comeback to the area, but they are usually heard and not seen.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Hiking, birding and wildlife viewing are popular activities around the lookout.</p><p>Guests access the lookout via the Evergreen Lookout Trail that climbs steeply through the old Evergreen Mountain Burn of 1967.  Hikers enter dense forest, where the grade eases a bit upon reaching a small saddle below the lookout. At this point, the trail  ascends again to reach the building. The trail is noted for  wildflowers, scenery and wildlife.</p>
