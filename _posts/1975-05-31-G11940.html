sub_title: Loop trail past Tumalo Falls, Doulble Falls, Upper Falls, North Fork Falls and Spring Creek Falls
overview: <p>The viewpoint for Tumalo Falls is a few steps from the parking lot or a short trail to the top. The top is a must worth the 5 minute walk.</p><p>The 89 foot fall along Tumalo Creek is one of the tallest and most beautiful waterfalls in Central Oregon. The area around the falls experienced a forest fire 25 years ago. The USFS has developed viewpoints both at the top and near the base of the falls making the views easy for everyone.</p><p>The exact origin of the word Tumalo is not known. According to the book Oregon Geographic Names, there are three possibilities; one is that is is from the Klamath Indian word Temelo, meaning wild plumb - which were at one point abundant in south central Oregon. Another Klamath word, Temola, meaning ground fog, could have been used to describe the nature of the Tumalo Creek area or perhaps the mist generated by the falls. A third, and most logical in our opinion, is that the original name may have been Tumallowa, which is said to mean icy water - an adjective which fits considering Tumalo Creek is fed by glacial melt.</p><p>Beyond Tumalo Falls you can continue along the river to Double Falls.  Many people stop here and turn back around.  </p><p>If you continue on you will see 3-5 more waterfalls but you will have to ford the creek (unless you can find a fallen log to cross)</p><p>After you ford the creek you will come across the Bend Watershed.  There is no camping allowed inside the watershed.</p><p> </p>
tips: '<p>To get here:  From Highway 97 in Bend, head west on Franklin Street. After about a mile you will turn right across the Deschutes River onto Galveston Street. Continue on Galveston past Century Drive when it becomes Skyliners Road. Follow this road for 10.5 miles and then take a left on to Forest Service Road 4601 which has a sign for Tumalo Falls. Follow this road as it becomes gravel all the way to the trailhead in another 2.5 miles. </p>'
