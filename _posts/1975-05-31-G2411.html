sub_title: This is a wonderful spring or early summer ski descent of the Hayden Glacier on Middle Sister
overview: <p>This is a very long day with an optional ascent to the summit of Middle Sister.  The fun part is the ski descent of the Hayden Glacier.  If you do this early enough in the spring you'll have a longer ski descent than we did but also may have to deal with trailhead access issues.   You will follow the Chambers Lake trail before striking off into the woods towards Haden Glacier (follow the gps track here).  You'll tell by the track that we walked a little too far down the Chambers Lake Trail.  We chose to go to the summit of Middle Sister before our descent but this is optional. </p>

  <p>Pole Creek Springs Trailhead Directions:
  Travel 1.5 miles west of Sisters on Hwy 242.  Turn south on Forest Service road 15 which is paved at first, but the pavement soon ends. Follow this road for 7.1 miles, where you'll reach a &quot;Y&quot; intersection. Stay left at the junction and follow Pole Creek signs for another few miles to the trailhead. </p>
