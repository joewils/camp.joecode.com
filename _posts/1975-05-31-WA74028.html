Elevations range from below 1,000 feet to more than 9,000 feet.</p><p> Visitors to the area can expect many days of clear, sunny weather in the summer, and winters with clear   skies and plenty of snow.</p>

Designated Wilderness provides thousands of pristine acres of incredible landscapes to enjoy in solitude or   with a small group.</p><p>Whitewater paddling on the Tieton River, near Windy Point Campground, is also a popular activity.</p>
