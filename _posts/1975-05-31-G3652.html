sub_title: 'After a long climb up from Oak Creek, this loop trail is an often-missed gem. '
overview: <p>This year-round mountain bike trail is a hidden gem of Mac/Dunn forest. It's just a short spin up a spur road near some of the most travelled areas of the forest, yet you'll likely never see a soul up here. </p><p>Along the way, look out for one of the largest Douglass firs in the area - literally! It's right in front of you on one of the switchbacks, if you take it too fast you may see it up close.  </p>
