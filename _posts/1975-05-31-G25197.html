overview: <p>10 in 10 Challenge rerun is about 16.7 miles long and located near Cumbria, United Kingdom. The trail is great for walking and normally takes a full day.</p><p>10 in 10 rerun challenge 2012This was a rerun of the 10 in 10 challenge that was supposed to run in June 2012. But was cancelled due to the terrible weather conditions in the area at the time. The 10 in 10 is a charity walk held each year to raise donations for the MS charity.This years route officially begins at the Swinside Inn and follows a circuit of 10 peaks starting with Causey Pike and the last peak being High spy. Officially you descend back to Swinside running parallel with Catbells not going over it.The order of peaks are:Causey PikeSail FellEel CragWandopeWhiteless PikeSnockriggRobinsonDale HeadMaiden MoorHigh SpyOur team, &quot;Vertically Challenged&quot; felt bad about accepting sponsorship money without doing the full challenge, so we decided to do it ourselves. The weather proved problematic along with scheduling the event around a date all of us could do it.We completed the trip just under 10 hours. We could have done this quicker but &nbsp;I suffered a stomach bug that slowed the team down on the ascent to Robinson. We had mixed fortunes with the weather. It set off overcast but the sun came out as we were ascending Snockrigg.On the summit of Robinson thunder storms appeared all around us. Although we they never got on top of us the rain finally did when we reached the 10th peak - High spy. </p>
tips: <p>Very&nbsp;strenuous&nbsp;walkFull day of walkingTake plenty of food and water - I used up nearly 4 litres of waterPack clothing for all conditionsNot child friendly.You could half the walk and finish at after Whiteless Pike and walk into Buttermere. Here there are buses running on the hour that can take you back to your carTake SunScreen!Snockrigg and Robinson ascents are steep - take your timeLots of descents = Sore knees! If you have hiking sticks take themTake a map of the area, weather can change quickly so plan escape routes back downIf you run out of water, there is a fast flowing stream you cross at the bottom of Dale head/ascending Maiden moor where you can refill your water bottlePark near to where you are going to finish, otherwise you need to add more time to complete the walk (like we did!) </p>
