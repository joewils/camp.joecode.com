overview: <p>The Indian Trail has a lot to offer on a short hike. There are several other trails that branch off from this trail which can provide numerous short hikes or for a full day of site seeing. To access the Indian Trail you can hike down the Red Town Trail from the main parking area or from the 171st street cul-de-sac. If you are not looking for a full day hike and are looking for a quick 1-2 hour hike, parking off of the 171st street is your best bet. From the cul-de-sac you can reach the Far County Falls in 20 minutes.</p><p>The Far County Falls are the main attraction on this trail. The size of the falls changes greatly depending on how much it has rained in the previous week. In the summer time the falls can be just a trickle of water, barely enough to moisten the mossy rocks. The best time to see the falls are in late winter to spring time. They are a great site to see as few people make the journey down to the falls due to how much they can vary. </p>
