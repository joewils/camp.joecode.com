Baker, the most prominent feature of the Wilderness Area.  Rising to 10,781 feet, the active volcano is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers.  Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.</p><p>The diverse forest provides an excellent habitat for a variety of wildlife. In addition to being home for a multitude of mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles, the area sustains more rare species such as lynx, moose, wolves, and wolverine.  Grizzly bear sightings have been confirmed in the Cascade region, though black bears are more common.</p>
