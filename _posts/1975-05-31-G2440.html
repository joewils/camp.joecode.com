sub_title: One of Seattle&rsquo;s most beloved parks. This hike loops around Green Lake.
overview: <p>Geologists say the Vashon Glacial Ice Sheet, which also formed Puget Sound and other area lakes, formed Green Lake 50,000 years ago. Dredgings of Green Lake have produced volcanic ash from an eruption of Glacier Peak that occurred about 6,700 years ago.</p><p>The lake was included in the Olmsted Brothers&rsquo; comprehensive parks plan, and was given to the City by the State of Washington in 1905. Green Lake underwent a series of changes over the next 15 years- it was diked, dredged and filled until it shrunk by nearly 100 acres! The last fill deposited in Green Lake was from the excavation of Aurora Avenue.</p><p>In more recent times, Green Lake has suffered from stagnation and pollution problems, as well as algae blooms. Milfoil and swimmers itch (caused by parasites from waterfowl) are still a consideration for those who swim in the lake.</p><p> </p>
