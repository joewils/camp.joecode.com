description: <p>Peavy Cabin was built in 1934 by Dr. George Wilcox Peavy, Dean of the School of Forestry at Oregon Agricultural College (later Oregon State University). The facility was used as his outdoor laboratory to instruct forestry students.</p><p>The cabin was then turned over to the Forest Service and used as a guard station. Several restoration projects have kept the integrity and charm of this historic structure, which is now recorded in the Heritage Resource Inventory as a historic site.</p><p>This cabin is available from July 1 until October 31 and is accessible via an unpaved road. High clearance and 4-wheel drive vehicles are recommended. Guests must bring some of their own supplies; however, Peavy Cabin does offers few modern conveniences to make for a comfortable stay.</p>

Turn left (east) on FSR 380 and travel approximately 3 miles to the end of the road to Peavy Cabin.  South of Baker City, take State Hwy 7 to the Sumpter Junction. Turn right and follow the Elkhorn Drive Scenic Byway through Sumpter and on to Granite.  From Granite, proceed north for approximately 7 miles on FSR 73 (Scenic Byway) to North Fork John Day Campground.  Turn east.  Continue approximately 5 miles on the Scenic Byway, turn right on FSR 380 and go 3 miles to Peavy Cabin.  CAUTION: FSR 380 is a native surface road and is not intended or suitable for low clearance passenger vehicles. Four-wheel drive and high clearance vehicles are strongly recommended. In spring, when the snow is melting and during rainy weather, road conditions can be hazardous due to washouts and possibly high water on the road. Please ask for current road conditions prior to driving the road. FSR 73 is closed in the winter from Anthony Lakes Ski area to Granite.</p>'
