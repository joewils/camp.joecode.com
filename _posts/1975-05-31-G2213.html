sub_title: 'Easy hike along Fall Creek takes you to several swimming holes and an old Native American hunting cave '
overview: <p>Begin near the Dolly Varden Campground, and follow the trail along Fall Creek the entire trip.  It's very easy, and would be perfect for taking kids.  If you bring your swimsuit there are many pools along the trail that you could stop for a swim.  At around the 3 mile point you will come across an area that was burned by a fire in 2003.</p><p>Keep on going to see the Slick Creek Cave.  A shallow cave that Native Americans used to camp at while on hunting trips.  Just make sure you cross the highway and go left to catch the trail on the north side of the creek. </p>
tips: <p>To get here take Hwy 58 east from I-5 for 14 miles and turn left across Dexter Reservoir.  Turn left on North Shore Drive, then the first right on Moss St.  Keep on this road until turning right on Big Fall Creek Rd (right before a covered bridge).  Follow this road (keeping left at the dam) for a little over 10 miles.  Park at a trail sign on the right before the bridge at Dolly Varden Campground.</p><p>Bring a swimsuit if you want to take a swim in one of the many swimming holes along the trail. </p>
