  <p>Henry's Fork Trailhead Directions (These can be tricky - use my track as a destination):
  From I-80 drive south on State Route 414 for 6 miles to Mountain View, WY.  414 turns west through the town and becomes route 410 at the west end of town.  Continue on 410 towards Robertson, WY for 6.7 miles to when the road turns west.  At this point turn onto Uinta County road 283 (Forest Road 072) and continue south towards Grahams Reservoir and Bridger Lake for another 12 miles.  At just over 12 miles turn onto Forest Road 17 and continue south 6.8 miles to Forest Road 077.  Drive south on this road for another nearly 3 miles to turn right on the road to Henry's Fork Campground and the trailhead.</p><p>No permits or fees to park here or to camp.  There may be a sign in register.  Make sure to sign in.
