The cabin was constructed in 1926 and was determined eligible for the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. The Mt. Adams Ranger District, in partnership with the Mt. Adams Institute, are proposing to garner outside funds (fundraise) to move an existing historic building to replace the burned cabin.

nearbyAttrctionDescription: <p>Guler Ice Cave is one mile west of the guard station. It is filled with spectacular ice formations that resemble stalactites, stalagmites, columns, fans and boxwork. The ice is believed to form because the cave acts as a trap, retaining the heavy cold air that settles into the cave in winter. As the snow melts above, moisture dripping into the cave forms into ice columns and masses. The cave is about 650 feet long, with four sections separated by three ceiling collapses.</p><p>The Forest Service has built a stairway down to the cave, but the steps can be slippery during winter. When exploring the cave, wear warm clothing, boots and a helmet. Use crampons if you have them. Have three sources of light.</p><p>Winter access requires cross-country skis, snowshoes or snowmobile. Many of the ice formations are just inside the cave entrance, so it&amp;#39;s not necessary to explore deep inside.</p>

orientationDescription: <p>A dense canopy of Douglas fir towers over the cabin and huckleberry bushes are thick in the understory.</p><p>Nearby Mt. Adams Wilderness is dominated by its namesake peak. At an elevation of 12,276 feet, Mount Adams looms over at least ten glaciers, forested slopes and subalpine meadows.</p><p>Wildlife in the area is abundant, including spotted owls, black tail deer, Roosevelt elk and black bear. The more elusive cougar, bobcat and pine marten are seen occasionally.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Many recreational opportunities are within close proximity of the guard station. Hiking, biking, fishing, hunting and mushroom and huckleberry picking are popular during the snow-free months. Guests can enjoy cross-country skiing and snowshoeing during winter.</p><p>The Pacific Crest Trail, Indian Heaven Wilderness and Mt. Adams Wilderness are all within easy driving distance and boast scenic vistas.</p><p>Atkisson Sno-Park is approximately 2.5 miles from the guard station and serves as a portal to the forest&amp;#39;s network of 95 miles of groomed snowmobile trails. Three signed, ungroomed cross-country ski loops also depart from the Atkisson Sno-Park, offering loop opportunities of 4 to 11 miles. Portions of these loops overlap with each other and the snowmobile trail network.</p>
