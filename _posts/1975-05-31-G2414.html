sub_title: Fun peaks with huge glacial cirques and views towards Jefferson and Santiam Pass.
overview: <p>These are two small peaks with views towards Jefferson and Santiam Pass.  Middle Pyramid has a trail to the top but North does not so you will have to use the GPS track and cut through the woods to reach the top.  I think the coolest part of this hike is the really steep and big glacial cirque you will be climbing up to reach the ridge of peaks.   </p>
tips: |-
  <p>Directions to Trailhead:
  From Salem drive 52 miles on HWY 22 to Detroit.  Go another 28 miles past Detroit and turn right on Lava Lake Meadow Road.  Follow signs for Old Cascade Crest Trails turning right at a fork 1.9 miles down the road.  Drive another 3.5 miles to the trailhead.  A Northwest Forest Pass is required to park here.  </p>
