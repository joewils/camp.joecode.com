sub_title: Hike up to a hidden lake with many great views of the Trinity Alps
overview: <p>This trail is pretty difficult but the views are well worth it if you have the energy.  It involves a lot of climbing up switchbacks and even wading through some pretty deep (and cold) water, but once you get to the top you will be glad you fought your way through it because the views of the lakes below and the mountains in the distance is something that you will never forget. </p>
tips: |-
  <p>Bring water with you, this hike takes a while and is exposed for the entire hike.
  You may want to carry some tough sandals with you because you will need to cross a river at the beginning and the water will be up to the knees. </p>
