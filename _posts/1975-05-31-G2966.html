sub_title: 'You can either drive to the top or hike to the top for a dramatic sunrise over Bend and the Sisters Volcano Complex '
overview: <p>This is one of those &quot;must see&quot; things in Oregon.  You can easily drive to the top of this peak which happens to be the highest point of the Newberry National Volcanic Monument.  My suggestion is that you do this at sunrise.  The sun rises in the east illuminating all of the volcanic rock spires of the peak and the Sisters Volcano Complex to the West.  It is one of the most beautiful sights I've seen in Oregon.  There are plenty of campground spots along the lakes where you can spend the night in preparation for a very early rise to do this trip.  Less than a mile up the road I've also included a gps track of a hiking trail that will bring you to the top as well.  Feel free to drop the most ambitious ones of your party with head lamps on this trail to climb it at dawn and meet you at the top for a ride down.   BRING A CAMERA. </p>

  <p>Directions to Summit Road
  From Highway 97, 24 miles south of Bend, take the Paulina Lake/East Lake Road on your left.  Follow this road 13 miles until you reach the Paulina Peak Road on your right.</p><p>There is an entrance fee into this area.  $5 I think. </p>
