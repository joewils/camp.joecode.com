sub_title: 'Seaside Beach and Forest Slope Walk. Bay Views, Vessels, Fish, Gulls and Hiproses. Swim or Spa Treat.  '
overview: <p>Walk in the surf of a beach considered one of the best in the world.</p><p>First enjoy the views of the Mols National Park and the new harbor city under construction right beneath you. Detour through an up-scale suburb for &rdquo;a Danish&rdquo; at a bakery. A walk on the trails through the Risskov Forest slopes with beech trees and bay views. Gather ramson leaves for the fish cakes later and try to make yourself heard among the rooks. Visit the old bathing establishment and &ldquo;the Vikings.&rdquo;</p><p>Then it can be time for your daily exercises in the free outdoor workout park before you descend to the harbor with the wooden ships. Next stop are the fishmongers where Scandinavian cold-water fish are on display. This is your chance to buy delicious fish cakes. Take them with you and step around the building to the wooden benches on the little land strip with view of the yacht harbor.</p><p>Now, if you haven&rsquo;t had an outdoor swim, you can choose going to the city center and Badeanstalten Spanien, an indoor spa for pampering and relaxation. </p>
tips: '<p>This is an all year round tour so dress according to season.</p><p>Wellies are convenient in the surf or in rainy weather. In summer you can walk barefoot in the sand. The forest slopes can be slippery and call for proper outdoor shoes.</p><p>Take a small outdoor bag packed with a water bottle/ hot bottle, swimsuit and towel.</p><p>Binoculars could be fun to take along on this tour for birds and the ships at sea.</p><p>A warm hood most times or a sunhat in summer will come in handy.</p><p>Note that on Sundays and holidays the fishmongers are closed.</p><p>Getting there: The tour starts in Aakrogen. Take bus nr. 20. Buses leave from downtown Aarhus i.e, (Park All&eacute;) every half hour during daytime. Hourly departures on Sundays and holidays.</p><p>Bring cash for the bus or share a multiple-ride ticket bought from kiosks. </p>'
