title: Wilderness Creek Trail
seo_title: wilderness-creek-trail
sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.
overview: <p>This is one of the most scenic trails on the south side of Cougar Mountain. It is also one of the steeper sections of the park, which from the parking area quickly gains 1000 ft. in elevation. There are a few breaks in the elevation gain towards the middle of the trail where you will pass through Shy Bear Marsh. Along the way there are a few creek crossings and some wooden bridges to aid in your crossings. At times there will be a few breaks in the forest where you can glimpse out over the top of the lower elevation trees and see the surrounding mountains.</p><p>If you are not in a hurry I would suggest taking this trail in route to the Wilderness Peak. It will only take you an extra 20-30 minutes but the views on this trail surpass the other routes up the mountain. Once you reach the end of the trail you will join up with the Wilderness Peak Trail, which takes you up a 1/2 mile trail to the peak. On your way back down you can either return the way you came up or take the Wilderness Cliffs Trail. This forms a nice loop that will connect back with the Wilderness Creek Trail midway down the mountain. Overall I think that this is one of my favorite trails to hike on for the views and a great trail run if you are looking for a challenging uphill run. </p>
tips: |-
  <p>How to get here:</p><p>From I-90, take exit 15 and head south on Highway 900 for 3.3 miles. The trailhead marker will be on your right, see guide photo, there will be an asphalt driveway leading uphill and to the right. The parking area will hold about 15 cars but rarely is full. There is an additional parking area 100 meters east, it is a small dirt pullout that can fit 2-3 cars and gives you direct access to the trail.</p><p>Connecting Trails:</p><p>Wilderness Peak Trail
