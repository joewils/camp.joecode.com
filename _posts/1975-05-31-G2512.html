sub_title: This guide covers nearly every trail possible in the park.
overview: <p>This is a great park for the family.  There are a bunch of trails that spiderweb their way around the woods behind the park.  There are a crazy amount of junctions in this track.  Use the track here as a guide to explore the area.  Don't worry, it's not big enough for you to get seriously lost.  There are also 3 different exits to neighborhoods and local roads so you'll always be able to get out ok.  This is great for biking. </p>
tips: <p>The park is located off of Walnet Blvd in North Corvallis.  Free parking.</p><p>I've heard that homeless sometimes use the park as a sleeping area so it is not advisable to explore these trails in the evening, especially after dark.  If you stick to the main park near Walnut you will be fine though. </p>
