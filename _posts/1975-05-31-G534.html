seo_title: snake-river-wees-bar-petroglyphs
sub_title: View ancient petroglyphs up close along the Snake River in Southwest Idaho.
overview: <p>This is an all day hike. If you decide to use a mountain bike, it becomes a half-day ride.</p><p>Walk across the Swan Falls Dam. Once across the dam, turn left and head upriver on the singletrack trail. Turn right where a doubletrack joins the trail. You 'll head up a short steep and rocky hill. Turn right on the major doubletrack trail and then turn right again heading downhill. Stay on the trail and you will pass the remnants of the Priest Ranch homestead and then an orchard. Turn left at the next junction, going uphill around a small butte that overlooks the river. Go through a narrow opening in the gate, continuing along the trail. You will know you are close to Wees Bar when you see a large pipe on the opposite side of the river. At Wees Bar, there will be a boulder field on the left side of the trail. </p><p>Once there, start looking for petroglyphs and Native American rock art. There are about 90 boulders with petroglyphs on them. Across from the boulder field near the river you will also find the ruins of the old Wees house.</p><p>Return the same way for an out-and-back. </p>
tips: <p>Avoid hiking in the canyon during high temperatures and bring plenty of water. There is about 300 feet of elevation gain.</p><p>Bring binoculars as you may see eagles hawks,or falcons in the area.</p><p>Restrooms and drinking fountains are at the Swan Falls Dam parking lot.</p><p>There is no trash pickup. Pack it in, pack it out. </p>
