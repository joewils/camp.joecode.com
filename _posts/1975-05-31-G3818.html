sub_title: A beautiful park along the Banks-Vernonia State Trail perfect for the whole family.
overview: <p>This park has over 20 miles of trails to explore and from the Hill Top area you will have spectacular views of the coast range.  The Banks-Vernonia Trail heads straight through tis park.  I have another guide for that as well.  This park also offers year round camping for the whole family with multiple cabins on site.  Check the links for more detailed information on the park.  The track in this guide is a nice loop around the main part of the park.  There are many many trails and I haven't provided turn for turn directions here.  Please refer to the links in this guide for a very detailed trail map and description of the trails within the park. </p>
tips: <p>Follow Route 47 north from Banks to the park.</p>
