overview: <p>This guide uses the most popular and beautiful trails in Washington Park to connect you with all the major sites and attractions within the area.  This is a great walk for the family as it includes a zoo and very cool Japanese Garden area.  You will have great views over Portland 1,000 feet below you from Pittock Mansion and from the International Rose Test Garden.  The Woodland Trail is one of the best trails in all of Washington Park and you will travel over most of it.  There are a lot of trails that intersect the track in this guide and I've tried to make as accurate directions as possible.  Use the track here as a guide but feel free to explore around the area as well. </p>
