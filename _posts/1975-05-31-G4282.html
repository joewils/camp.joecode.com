seo_title: hagg-lake-mountain-biking-loop
sub_title: One of the best mountain biking areas in the Portland Metro area.
overview: <p>This trail offers varied terrain from steep hill climbs to quick sections of road biking to some technical terrain.  This trail was opened to bikers around 2004 and quickly became one of the more popular loop trails for mountain bikers in the Portland Area.   You'll have views of Mt. Hood from several places and you can even take a swim in the lake on hot days.  Be warned that in the rainy season these trails can become pretty muddy.  If you have time and have brought your binnoculars this is also a great place for bird watching with observation decks along the lakeshore for viewing.  There are plenty of parking areas off the road around the lake.  You can choose whichever one you'd like to start at and the trail is pretty easy to follow.  The consensus is that the best direction to travel on bike is clockwise around the lake. </p>
tips: '<p>There is a day pass rate of $5 to park within the area which can be picked up at the booth as you enter the park.  From Forest Grove follow the signs for Hagg Lake.  Scoggins Valley Road which takes you to the lake is off of Highway 47 headed south from Forest Grove. </p><p>Tip:  During blackberry season wear long sleeves or you''ll be slashed up on parts of the trail. </p>'
