sub_title: One lap around the reservoir.
overview: <p>TVA Raccoon Mountain is my favorite place to run. With a variety of trail options and unmatched views of the surrounding mountains the venue is an example of what can happen when you allow recreational access to public land. It is clean, well used and represents the nature of the city and surrounding area. Thanks to the members of SORBA for the time, money and ongoing efforts to build and maintain these trails. This route is the shortest route around the reservoir using the trails. There are great views, a couple of climbs, rocks, roots and creeks and a pond. </p>
tips: <p>Carry water. Be alert for mountain bikers while on the trails, I just step aside and let 'em go. Park at East Overlook. Do not leave valuables in car. TVA has gone to private security this year and there have been break-ins. East Overlook is safer because of a higher volume of traffic. The trails get pretty busy in the evenings and weekends. Be gone before sunset. </p>
