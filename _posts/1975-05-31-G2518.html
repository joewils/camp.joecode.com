seo_title: sulphur-springs-and-soap-creek-area-north-macdunn-forrest
sub_title: This is a fun exploratory guide of some less ridden trails in the MacDunn forrest.
overview: '<p>Use this track to explore the northern side of MacDunn on your bike.  This guide takes you up a 1,500 ft climb to the top of a peak and then down some really fun, yet technical, singletrack.  You''ll have the option at POI #5 to cruise back down the road to your car or climb up a little ways again to explore another section and loop back to your vehicle. </p>'
tips: |-
  <p>The Singletrak descent from the top gets really muddy in the spring and fall so please try to avoid taking this in wet conditions to cut down on erosion.</p><p>Directions:
  From Lewisburg on Highway 99 head West on Lewisburg Ave towards the Lewisburg Saddle.  Take a right onto Sulphur Springs Road and follow it until you get to the car pull-out. </p>
