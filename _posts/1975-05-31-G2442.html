PLEASE LEAVE A REVIEW IF YOU HAVE BEEN HERE AND IT IS REOPENED.</p><p>This loop trail takes you through an old growth forest ecosystem.</p><p>The name Pawn came from an early 1900s community near the current location of the trail. Pawn is an acronym for the four families who were instrumental in establishing a post office on the upper portion of the North Fork Siuslaw River above Minerva. The four families were, the Pooles, Akerleys, Worthingtons, and Nolands. Marion Woosley ran the post office so the &quot;W&quot; eventually came to stand for Woosley. </p>'
