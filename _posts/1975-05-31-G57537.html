overview: <p>Tall Trees Trail is about 4 miles long and located near Orick, California in Redwoods National Park. The trail is great for hiking and normally takes a half day.</p><p>Nice hike through a pretty remote part of Redwood NP. To gain access to the trailhead you need to stop by the Kuchel visitor center on the coast to get a pass and the combination to the lock on the access gate. It is about 7 miles up to the gate from 101 and about 6 miles down to the trailhead from the gate. The little extra effort is worth it. There was absolutely no one on the trail or access road. The trail runs gently down to the Redwood River through some amazing groves of huge trees. It is about 1.5 miles down, then there is a 1 mile flat loop at the bottom with really interesting flora along with more huge trees. </p>
tips: <p>Get the pass from the visitor center. Be prepared for a 6 mile dirt road down to the trailhead from the gate. </p>
