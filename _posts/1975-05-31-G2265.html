sub_title: A moderate 6-mile out and back climb of Mount Si in Washington
overview: <p>The hike starts at the parking lot and the trail head is clearly marked, in a couple hundred yards you will begin your ascent to the top of Mount Si. The trail is well-maintained and dog-friendly, but be aware that there have been reports of bear spottings on the trail (although not very often).</p><p>Most of the hike is under the shade of the trees amove which makes it a good hike even in the heat of summer.</p><p>The trail ends on a rocky surface known as the Haystack, which can be very slippery when wet. You'll need some climbing experience if you plan to get to the top of the haystack. </p>
