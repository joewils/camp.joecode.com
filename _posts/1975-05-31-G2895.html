seo_title: cascade-canyon-trail-grand-teton-national-park
sub_title: This is an unbelievable hike up into the base of the Grand Tetons via a boat ride across Jenny Lake.
overview: <p>This hike will bring you deep into the Teton Mountain Range.  This popular hike will start from the shore of the lake and take you up to the 200 foot tall Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point which provides great views out over the National Park.  Most people will stop at this point but this guide will take you a little further up into Cascade Canyon where you might spot a moose or two before heading back for the boat return across Jenny Lake. </p>
tips: |-
  <p>Trailhead:
  This is located at the Jenny Lake Visitor Center.  Simply follow the signs for the Jenny Lake Boat Ramp.  You can park at the visitor center.  There is also a 3.3 mile one way trail around the lake to get to the start of the canyon trail but trust me it is worth the $10 trip via the boat across the lake to shave 6.6 miles off the hike!  </p><p>There is a $20 fee to enter the National Park as well. </p>
