sub_title: Hike this short section of the McKenzie River Trail to the beautiful Tamolitch (Blue Pool)
overview: <p>The McKenzie River trail is twenty six miles long and runs from Clear Lake to McKenzie Bridge.  It's world famous for Mountain Bikers, and very nice for hikers as well.</p><p>This short portion of the trail takes you to the beautiful turquoise Tamolitch Pool, also known as Blue Pool.</p><p>Beginning of this easy hike is through old growth Douglas fir forest.  As the McKenzie river falls away you walk along the cliff.  Eventually you come upon an old lava flow.  </p><p>At Blue Pool you can scamper down the steep embankment and go for a VERY chilly swim.  This pool is actually where the McKenzie river comes back up after being underground just after Carmen Reservoir.  It's known as a dry falls, because during especially wet rainy winters the river will flood over the lava bed and waterfall into Tamolitch. </p>
tips: <p>To get here take the McKenzie Hwy 126 14 miles east of McKenzie Bridge.  If you are coming from the Hwy 20 junction it's about 10 miles past south of the junction.  Turn at the Trailbridge Campground sign, you will cross a bridge and quickly turn right onto a gravel road. After about a third of a mile park at the signs for the trail crossing.</p><p>Bring your hiking shoes or bring your bike.  The McKenzie River trail is shared by hikers and mountain bikers alike so respect each other.</p><p>Bring a swim suit if you want a very cold dip in the pool. </p>
