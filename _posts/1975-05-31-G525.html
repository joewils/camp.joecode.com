sub_title: Clamber around the rocks of an enormous volcanic rockslide.
overview: "<p>Located four hours north east of San Francisco this Northern California park might be a little out of the way, but it&rsquo;s a prime destination for seekers of tranquility and those with even just a passing interest in geology.</p><p>In geological terms the landscape of Lassen Volcanic National Park is about as young as it gets, and for an example you need look no further than Chaos Crags, a mountain of pink dacite that sprouted from the earth only a thousand years ago.</p><p>Even more recent was the Chaos Jumbles rockslide - a massive carpet of rock which separated from the mountain and careened down its flanks at speeds over 100mph, devastating the forest below and only coming to rest after spilling up the side of Table Mountain a whole two miles away. </p><p>Our short 3&frac12; mile hike winds through evergreen forest, across the Chaos Jumbles and up to the foot of the Chaos Crags cliffs.</p><p>Elevation gain: \n&bull; 850ft (from 5,900 - 6,700ft)</p><p>Tips:\n&bull; Summer through fall is the best time to experience this trail. Snow covers the Lassen landscape for much of the year, closing roads and obscuring trails. See our links below to National Park Service information on road and trail closures.\n&bull; Bug repellent is a necessity early in the summer season when mosquitoes are rife. </p>"
