orientationDescription: <p>Towering Silver Fir Campground , western red cedar and hemlock trees provide plenty of shade. Most sites are just a short walk to the river.</p><p>Rugged peaks, scenic rivers and abundant wildlife define the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and surrounding designated wilderness areas. On a clear day visitors can see Mt. Baker, which rises to an elevation of 10,781 feet. The active volcano is perpetually snow-capped. Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.</p><p>Wildlife in the area ranges from mountain goats in the higher elevations to pine marten and porcupine on the forest floor. Migratory birds and native fish find ample habitat in the varied ecosystems as well.</p>

Baker Ranger District. The trail climbs steadily for two miles through forests and lush, open meadows with stellar views of glaciated Mt. Baker.
