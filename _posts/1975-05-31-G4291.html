sub_title: Beautiful waterfall over basalt cliffs into a wave-tossed pool.
overview: <p>Toketee Falls is one of the most famous waterfalls in all of Oregon, renowned far and wide for the graceful columnar basalt formation framing the two-stepped falls. The North Umpqua River has carved a sinuous gorge out of the lava flow, resulting in a waterfall of 113 feet in height - a 28 foot upper tier which plunges into a pool flanked by a deep alcove, followed by an 85 foot plunge into a large pool. </p><p>At the trailhead, the wooden 12 foot diameter Toketee Pipeline is passed, which diverts much of the volume of the North Umpqua River to a powerhouse downstream. This artificial taming of the river allows the waterfall to flow in an extremely consistent manor all year long.</p><p> </p>
tips: <p>To get here take Hwy 138 east of Roseburg.  Between milepost 58 and 59 turn north on Toketee-Rigdon road 34.  Keep left at all road junctions to the parking ara. </p>
