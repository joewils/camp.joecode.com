description: <p>Spanish Creek Cabin was constructed in 1934 and retains much of its rustic character from that time. The cabin is available year-round and offers an excellent base camp for a variety of summer and winter recreation opportunities. It is adjacent to a popular trailhead and a campground.</p><p>Guests can drive to the cabin when there is no snow, but winter access is generally by snowshoes or skis for approximately 3.5 miles from the end of the plowed road. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.</p>
drivingDirection: <p>From Bozeman, Montana, travel south on Highway 191. Turn right on Spanish Creek Road and travel 5.5 miles west on the gravel road.  At the end of the gravel, turn left and head south on paved road.  Drive 4 miles to the Spanish Creek Trailhead. Just after crossing a bridge over Spanish Creek and before the parking area, take the small road to the left, pass through the gate and follow the road a quarter mile to the cabin. The lock on the gate has the same combination as the cabin.  During the winter, Spanish Creek Road is plowed for three or four miles, but vehicles can generally drive to the beginning of the pavement. Snowdrifts above this point usually prohibit further travel by vehicle.</p>
facilitiesDescription: <p>The two-story cabin has bunk beds and beds with mattresses to sleep up to four people. A wood cook stove is provided. In a kitchen area cleaning equipment is available.</p><p>A campfire ring is located in front of the cabin. An outhouse is equipped with a vault toilet.</p><p>Electricity and water are not provided. Guests need to bring their own drinking water, bedding, food, lanterns or flashlights, extra toilet paper, dish soap, garbage bags and first aid supplies, among other necessities. The cabin will need to be cleaned and all trash removed before leaving.</p>
