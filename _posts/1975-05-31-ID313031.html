description: <p> Ponderosa State Park covers most of a 1,000-acre peninsula that juts into beautiful Payette Lake near McCall.  The scenic overlook at Osprey Point offers a spectacular view of the lake.  The park offers hiking and biking trails, guided walks with park naturalists and evening campfire programs. There are several ways to have a great time while visiting Ponderosa State Park.   The park&amp;#39;s namesake, the 150-foot-tall ponderosa pine, is the most noticeable species of tree. Douglas fir, grand fir, lodgepole pine and western larch also grow in the park.  The character of the park is molded by its diverse topography. It ranges from arid sagebrush flats to forested lakeside trails; from even ground to steep cliffs; and from dense forest to spongy marsh.  The park is rich in wildflowers, especially along the interpretive trail that winds around the Meadow Marsh.  Nature trails and gravel roads have been developed so visitors can enjoy opportunities to view wildlife in these areas.  Wildlife that can be viewed at the park includes Canada geese, osprey, bald eagles, wood ducks, mallards, songbirds, deer, moose, beaver, muskrats and even bear.</p><p>Camping is available within the park in four locations. Located in the main unit of the park is the Peninsula Campground, this area offers 113 campsites, 23 of which are companion sites - with water and 30-amp electric hook-ups,  one camper cabin, fire rings, picnic tables, dump station, three bath houses with hot showers and flush toilets.  Near the main entrance to the park is the RV Group Campground, this area offers 50 campsites, 10 of which are companion sites.  All sites have water, 30/50-amp electric, and sewer hook-ups, fire ring and picnic table.  The bath house is centrally located in the campground. Northwest Passage Campground is located at the north end of Payette Lake and offers 22 non-reservable campsites, fire rings, tables, central water, and vault toilets.  The park also has five deluxe cabins nestled along the shore of Payette Lake near the Visitor Center.  These cabins are fully equipped with all the comforts of home and can sleep up to five to eight people. Additional camping equipment is not permitted with the deluxe cabins. Pets are not permitted at the cabins.   The park has two covered picnic shelters and an open lawn area that can be reserved through the park.  A deep draft boat launch is located within the main unit of the park.  Horseshoes and volleyballs are available at the Visitor Center.   Home to one of Idaho&amp;#39;s Premium Nordic Ski Grooming opportunities, Ponderosa State Park boasts 12 miles of groomed trails - 19.3 kilometers.  Nordic trails range from recreational to competition to accommodate all abilities.  The park also has 3.4 miles of designated snowshoe trails through the forest that offer viewpoints of the lake. </p>
