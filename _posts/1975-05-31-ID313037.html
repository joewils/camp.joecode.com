Popular for all types of boating, prevailing winds on the water make it especially well suited for sailing and windsurfing.</p><p>Rainbow trout, Coho salmon, small mouth bass and perch can be caught from the shore or by boat in the summer or through the ice in the winter.   Hiking, bird watching, photography, mountain biking, all types of boating, ice fishing, snowmobiling, cross country skiing, and just plain relaxing are all easily accessible from Lake Cascade State Park.   Lake Cascade offers two group camping opportunities, including a group camp and the Osprey Point group yurt complex,  200 individual campsites in 7 developed campgrounds (with Ridgeview offering power, water and some sewer at each site), dispersed camping areas with primitive camping, several day use areas, and 6 boat launch ramps.</p><p>The various campgrounds and facilities of the park are dispersed around Lake Cascade&amp;#39;s forty-one square miles of surface water and 86 miles of shoreline.
