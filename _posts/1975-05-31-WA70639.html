orientationDescription: <p>The Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest showcases rugged peaks, sparkling alpine lakes, and old-growth forests, providing visitors with unique and surprising  landscapes.</p><p>Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area, dominates the landscape on a clear day. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, the active  volcano from which the forest takes its name is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is  actually a mound of ice 1,300 feet deep, which hides a massive volcanic crater.</p><p>Wildlife in the area includes mountain goats traversing the higher elevations, to coyotes and pine marten in the forests. Migratory birds and native fish find ample  habitat in the varied ecosystems as well. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to  live.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>At the campground, Troublesome Creek is a delight for exploring. A footbridge crosses the bubbling creek beneath towering pine and fir trees. For guests wanting to relax at the water&amp;#39;s edge, or children searching for newness in nature, this is an ideal spot without even leaving the campground.</p><p>The adjacent North Fork Skykomish River offers fishing for steelhead and salmon.</p><p>For those wanting to venture further, the Beckler Peak Trail may be included on the agenda. Located 10 miles from the town of Skykomish, this trail is challenging, but worth the effort, offering hikers the opportunity to view the diverse landscapes of the area from a variety of perspectives.</p><p> At the Jennifer Dunn Trailhead, the trail starts out on a decommissioned logging road, and climbs through young alder and vine maple to an expansive vista of the Skykomish Valley. The trail continues to switchback through huge trees and by the remains of a trapper&amp;#39;s cabin. Climbing higher, and upon reaching the final ridge top through steep alpine forest, hikers will be in awe of the panoramic view of near and distant peaks.</p>
