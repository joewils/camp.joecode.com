orientationDescription: <p>Because of its wide geographic range, the Okanogan-Wenatchee is a stunning and unique National Forest. High, glaciated alpine peaks tower along the Cascade Crest. Lush valleys of old growth forest define its western boundary. And, at its eastern edge, rugged shrub-steppe country comprises a more arid region.</p><p>Elevations range from below 1,000 ft. to over 9,000 ft.</p><p> The Naches River, adjacent to Sawmill Flat Campground, is a tributary of the Yakima River in central Washington. In its upper reaches the river flows through rugged terrain and areas of pristine wilderness. Before joining the Yakima River it makes its way through valleys and is a significant irrigation source for areas northwest of Yakima.</p><p>Used by Native Americans and settlers throughout history, the river has served as an natural corridor between the east and west sides of the Cascades through the Naches Pass.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest offers a multitude of recreational activities for its visitors.</p><p>In addition to being a prime location for hiking, fishing, hunting, horseback riding and mountain biking in summer and early fall,  the area provides excellent skiing and snowshoeing in the winter.</p><p>Hikers and backpackers are especially fortunate to have access to a variety of spectacular trails near the campground and in the   surrounding areas. Designated Wilderness provides thousands of pristine acres of incredible landscapes to enjoy in solitude or with a small group.</p><p>Frost Mountain Lookout Trail is a favorite for many in the area, and river enthusiasts may enjoy a whitewater paddle on the nearby American River.</p>
