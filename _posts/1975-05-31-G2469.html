sub_title: An unbelievable hike on the Oregon Coast culminating with a sunset walk down a broad beach.
overview: <p>This is an amazing hike that takes you on a walk through the woods, to a historic lighthouse and then returns you to your vehicle via a wonderful beach walk.  I suggest that you do this hike mid-afternoon so that you can time your hike back along the beach at sunset.  It is a great finish to a fun hike.  Even though you'll have to ascend a couple hundred of feet to get to the lighthouse the views south down the coast from it are well worth it. </p>
tips: <p>The trailhead is 14 miles north of Florence in the day-use area of Carl Washburne State Park.  No permit required here (a rare thing).   </p>
