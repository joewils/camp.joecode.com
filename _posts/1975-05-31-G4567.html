sub_title: A short hike through old growth temperate rainforest, only minutes outside town!
overview: <p>This is the best place to see what the Coastal Range used to look like before European settlers and modern logging. The massive trees here were sheltered by the steep valley and later donated to OSU as part of the Research Forest. It's an impressive place, even more so when you realize that the entire area used to look similarly. </p>
