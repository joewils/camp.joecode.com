orientationDescription: <p>Hemmed in by several designated wilderness areas, the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest showcases rugged peaks, sparkling alpine lakes and old-growth forests.</p><p>Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area, dominates the landscape on a clear day. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, the active volcano from which the forest takes its name is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.</p><p>More than 700 lakes and mountain ponds dot the glacier-carved terrain of nearby Alpine Lake Wilderness. Tree-covered valleys give way to rocky ridges and rugged peaks along the crest of the Cascades. Many peaks and slopes are permanently cloaked in snowfields.</p><p> Congress designated the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in 1976 with a total of 362,789 acres, 117,862 of which lie in the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>In addition to being a prime location for hiking and fishing in summer and early fall, Miller River offers excellent skiing and snowshoeing in the winter months.</p><p>The Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest&amp;#39;s 1,500 miles of trails can entice any hiker to get outdoors. From smooth paths meandering through deep quiet forests to challenging ascents up boulder-studded mountains, opportunities abound for every skill level.</p><p>The nearby Dorothy Lake Trail begins in a densely shaded forest for approximately 1.5 miles to the outlet of Dorothy Lake, then continues along the lake&amp;#39;s eastern edge for another 2 miles to its inlet. From here the trail climbs steeply over a ridge and enters the Snoqualmie Ranger District. Permits are needed for both day-use hiking and overnight backpacking and camping in Wilderness Areas.</p>
