orientationDescription: <p>Located in the majestic Cascade region of Washington, the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest showcases rugged peaks, scenic rivers and lush forests.</p><p> The banks of the Stillaguamish River are lined with old-growth forests of cedar, fir and hemlock.</p><p>  On a clear day visitors can spot Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, this active volcano is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.</p><p>The surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests support an abundance of wildlife. In addition to being home for a multitude of mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles, the area sustains more rare species such as lynx, moose, wolves and wolverine. Grizzly bear sightings have been confirmed in the Cascade region, though black bear sightings are more common.</p>
