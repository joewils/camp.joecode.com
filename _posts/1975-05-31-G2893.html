sub_title: A beautiful hike to a glacial lake beneath a massive melting glacier.
overview: '<p>This is one of the most beautiful hikes in the entire National Park.  The wonderfully maintained park trail will take you past beautiful lakes onto steep hillsides with sweeping views of waterfalls and glaciers all around you.  You will probably see a lot of wildlife on the trip as well so be ready with your camera.  When you get to Grinnell Lake you will see icebergs (no joke) floating in the lake from the rapidly retreating Grinnell Glacier.  It is not advisable to walk on the glacier as there are crevasses but if you are careful and are there during the late summer the crevasses should be very visible and you can take a very cautious stroll onto the ice as I did in the gps track in this guide.</p><p>Tip:  Please see the linked site to this guide before going on this hike.  It will be worth it.  If you can''t find the link just go to Wikipedia and type in Grinnell Glacier to see how the glacier has changed over the past 75 years. </p>'

  <p>Grinnell Glacier Trailhead Directions:
  From the park you will need to take the Going to the Sun Highway north through the entire park to the small town of St. Mary and the intersection with Route 89.  Follow Route 89 north to Babb and then take a left onto the Many Glacier Road.  Follow that road to the end and find a place to park.  I don't believe there are parking fees for day hikes.  Just before the official end of the road you will see a parking area for the trail.  Use the gps track in this guide as a reference.  </p><p>There is a $20 fee to enter the park last time I checked. </p>
