sub_title: A beautiful peninsula into the Pacific Ocean with plenty of views
overview: <p>There isn't much elevation change in this peninsula walk, just great views!  You'll be hiking along cliffs 400 feet above the water below.  If you are lucky and its not raining you'll be rewarded with amazing views.  Even if it is foggy I'd suggest going for hike anyway as often times the fog lifts on your way back.   </p>
tips: |-
  <p>Directions:
  From Tillamook dreive west on the Three Capes Scenic Highway (a couple view pull-offs by the way to stop at) for 13 miles.  You'll see signs for the trailhead.   </p>
