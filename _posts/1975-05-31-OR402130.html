importantInformation: '<p>At this time the boat moorages are closed for the 2014 season for repairs. The park will determine future availability of boat moorages by June 12, 2014. No campsites with lake front access or a view of the lake. IMPORTANT: Please refer to the Site Information at the end of this confirmation letter for specific vehicle restrictions at this site. Trailers (Within 18ft of length) allowed in designated tent sites only (very limited sites). As of October 1, 2014 trailers will no longer be permitted in any C loop tent sites. Please phone park for additional information. Only one vehicle is included with site fees. If site is able to accommodate a second vehicle there is an additional fee of $5 per night, paid upon arrival at park. (changing to $7.00 per night May 1, 2014) All vehicles must fit on paved pad and be clear of the roadway. There is a maximum of two vehicles per site. There is no charge for vehicles being towed into park. Customer Awareness Alert: * Blue-green algae blooms occur at Devil&apos;s Lake, most often between April and September, however can occur during any time of the year. * If an outbreak does occur, swallowing or inhaling water droplets should be avoided, as well as skin contact with water by humans or animals. Current algae bloom advisories are found in the Recreational Advisories at http://public.health.oregon.gov * Fee waivers and/or adjustments will not be provided due to the presence of Blue-green algae. In the event of algae bloom, all cancel and change policies as defined by OPRD Administrative Rules will apply. *Reservations for more than five nights/days that are later changed to fewer nights/days will be charged a fee equal to the nightly/daily site fee for each night/day canceled as well as the $8 transaction fee. Please be aware that only the person whose name is on the reservation may access, change or cancel the reservation. You can stay 14 consecutive nights in a single campground, and may return after spending at least three nights out of the park (it can be another state park campground; in fact, we recommend you DO select another state park campground). The maximum time allowed within any Oregon State Park is 14 nights within any 17 night period. Customers who wish to secure more than one site within a park for a continuous date period in order to accommodate their reservation request (i.e. split reservation), should be aware that the $8.00 reservation fee would apply to each site reserved. Reservation fee adjustments will not be made after reservations have been confirmed using the internet reservation service. If you are viewing inventory and find you are unable to secure one site to accommodate your request please consider calling the call center at 1-800-452-5687 to make your reservation. Discount programs which may be offered through the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department cannot be processed when making an internet reservation. For additional information on discount programs call the OPRD Information Center at 1-800-551-6949 or visit us online at www.OregonStateParks.org. Reservations can be made 24 hours a day, from 2 days to 9 months in advance. Campsite availability is based on call center hours, meaning sites become available when the call center opens. Call center hours are: Monday through Friday 8am to 5pm. </p>'
