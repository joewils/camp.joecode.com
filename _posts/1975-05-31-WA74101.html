orientationDescription: <p>The site lies among lush ancient forests of western red cedar, western hemlock and Douglas fir trees. The creek&amp;#39;s headwaters begin in the surrounding mountains, pick up cold, clean glacial meltwater along the way and eventually empty into the Skagit River.</p><p> The creek provides a sampling of the colorful crystalline rocks of the North Cascade Core, which formed deep underground and is now revealed in the rugged terrain of the North Cascade Range.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Nature abounds in the Goodell Gorge, where visitors enjoy exploring the scenery, viewing wildlife and birding. Both grizzly and black bears inhabit the area, so caution must be taken while hiking, picnicking or camping.</p><p> Many miles of hiking trails are within a short drive. The creek and nearby Skagit River offer fishing for trout, salmon and steelhead. There is no boating or swimming at the site.</p>
