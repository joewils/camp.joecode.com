description: <p>Montana&amp;#39;s first and best-known state park showcases one of the most highly decorated limestone caverns in the Northwest. Naturally air conditioned, these spectacular caves, lined with stalactites, stalagmites, columns, and helictites, date back through time.   The hiking trails, rental cabins, and campground are open year-round; tours of the caverns are available from May 1-September 30.</p><p>Plan to spend a minimum of 2 hours to hike 2 miles on the guided tour through the caverns. The park also provides trails, a brand new visitor center, amphitheater, picnic areas, large campground, showers, RV dump facilities, tipi, and 3 cabins. Please be aware that water is turned off from October 1-April 30, so flush toilets, showers, drinking water, and the RV dump facilities are available only during the summer.</p><p>It&amp;#39;s always a great time to explore the colorful limestone formations with a knowledgeable and friendly guide. See the geologic development, learn the history of early exploration and gain an insight into the delicate ecology of this world without light. While you&amp;#39;re at the park, you might also want to hike or bike the extensive trail system, attend an interpretive program, or purchase a unique item in the gift shop. You can use this park as a base camp while you enjoy several nearby state parks, attractions, and the adjacent Jefferson River.  </p>
