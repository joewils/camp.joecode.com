seo_title: long-view-peak-trail
sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.
overview: <p>The Long View Peak Trail is a short trail that begins at the peak of the Wilderness Creek Trail. It is a very short trail that will lead you towards the Doughty Falls found a short distance away on the Deceiver Trail. </p><p>Most of the elevation gain is behind you now. There is little elevation gain or loss on this trail despite the fact that you will be hiking over a peak. Once at the top of the peak you will find a horse hitch, if you rode up, and will be surrounded by large Douglas fir trees. There is not much of a view, contrary to the name of the peak, but there are a few breaks in the foliage where you can see the vast forest of the western portion of Cougar Mountain.</p><p>I would suggest continuing on if you have made it this far to catch a glimpse of Doughty Falls. If you are looking for a full days hike, it is possible to hike down Deceiver Trail then onto Shy Bear Pass to make a large loop and see some great sites. </p>
