Explosive geologic events have shaped the distinctive landscape on the nearly 1 million-acre forest, and provide spectacular scenery as well as an abundance of natural and cultural resources.</p><p>The translation of the word, &amp;quot;umpqua,&amp;quot; meaning &amp;quot;thundering waters,&amp;quot; defines the area. High mountain lakes, heart-stopping rapids, peaceful ponds and thundering waterfalls, including the 272-foot Watson Falls on the North Umpqua Highway, offer visitors plenty of pastimes.</p><p> Diverse ecosystems support a wide range of habitat for wildlife common to the area. From eagles and owls, to salamanders and salmon, these species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests to live.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>In addition to being a prime location for hiking, fishing, biking, and boating in summer and early fall, Deer Creek Flat offers excellent skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling in the winter months.</p><p>The North Umpqua River, adjacent to this campground, drains portions of the western side of the Cascade Range. Almost 34 miles of of this river have been designated as a Wild and Scenic River, set aside exclusively for fly-fishing.  Renowned for outstanding salmon and steelhead fishing and exhilarating whitewater challenges, the North Umpqua River offers an ideal setting for many recreational pursuits.</p><p> The Illahee Flat Trail descends from the nearby Horseshoe Bend Campground and continues from Illahee Flat to the Jessie Wright Segment of the North Umpqua Trail.</p><p>The 79 mile North Umpqua Trail parallels the river and offers visitors challenging hiking and mountain biking experiences.</p>
