sub_title: ''
overview: <p>This is a spectacular hike through upper alpine volcanic mountains in the central Cascades mountains of Oregon. The views are well worth the trip up a winding switch back single  track trail. Starting at the trail head from Three Creek Lake, you can get some great views of Broken Top, North and Middle Sister and Mt Jefferson. </p>
tips: '<p>Best time to experience this hike is early August when in most cases the snow has melted. The road from the town, Sisters to Three Creek Lake is mostly paved except for the last mile or two. The trail is rocky, dusty and dry. There are no creeks along the trail so bring plenty of water. Bring your lunch and sit along the Tam rim to enjoy the great views of the Central Cascades. Don''t forget the sunblock too. The views are spectacular so also bring your camera.. Truly worth the hike</p><p>Elevation gain is around 2400 feet per 2.6 miles. Difficulty is generally moderate to difficult depending upon your physical condition especially in higher elevations. NOTE: The Rim is about 8000 feet. </p>'
