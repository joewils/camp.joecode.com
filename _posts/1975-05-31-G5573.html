overview: |-
  <p>This loop walk provides an overview of much of Patrick Point but still leaves out plenty of activities and destinations for the rest of the day or weekend.  It takes advantage of trail segments throughout the park to build one larger walk.  At the same time, it can provide a foundation for detours down to beaches, tide pools, and most of the park's other attractions.  To really see everything here, it takes a weekend trip.  When talking with camping visitors, I was amazed at the number who keep coming back year after year!</p><p>Patrick Point is well known for a lot happening in a small place with several miles of trails, beaches, tide pools, a local famed Wedding Rock (still a popular place for weddings), and the list goes on.</p><p>Patrick's Point State Park is a 640 acre park located about 25 miles North of Eureka in the heart of California's coast redwood country. </p><p>The park activities include:
  Hiking, biking, several camp options, a visitor center, interpretive programs, an active reconstructed Yurok Indian village.a native plant garden, visitor center, and 3 group picnic areas.</p><p>The park's forests are primarily spruce, hemlock, pine, fir and red alder which abound on an ocean headland.  The forests are broken by extensive wildflower meadows.</p><p>The dramatic shoreline includes sandy beaches and sheer cliffs rising above the Pacific Ocean. Opportunities are here to explore tide pools, search for agates, driftwood, whale watching, sea lions, and birding. </p>
