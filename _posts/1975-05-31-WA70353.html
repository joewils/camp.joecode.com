orientationDescription: <p>The Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest offers visitors the chance to discover, or rediscover nature on a personal level.  Rugged peaks, scenic rivers, and interesting wildlife define the forest and surrounding designated wilderness areas.</p><p>On a clear day visitors will see Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area.  Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, the active volcano from which the forest takes its name is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers.  Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.   On the banks of the Stillaguamish River, visitors can explore a unique ecosystem typical of the area.  Old-growth forests line the wide, gently-flowing river, known for its salmon run.  Populations of chinook, coho, chum, pink, and sockeye spawn in the river and its tributaries.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest has 1,500 miles of trails, ranging from smooth paths through deep, quiet forests to challenging ascents up boulder-studded mountains. Hiking opportunities abound for every skill level.</p><p>The Mt. Dickerman Trail, located near the campground, switchbacks steeply for 3 miles through a dark forest to an alpine meadow, replanted in 1915 after a major forest fire. From this point, the trail rises above the timberline to an alpine meadow alive with wildflowers in July and August.</p><p>The trail is in generally good condition, and spectacular views can be seen from all directions as the trail climbs to the 5723 foot summit.</p>
