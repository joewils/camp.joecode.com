Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, this active volcano is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.</p><p> Wildlife in the area include mountain goats, coyotes, pine marten and a variety of migratory birds and native fish.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>In addition to being a prime location for hiking, fishing, picnicking and horseback riding in summer and early fall, Denny Creek offers excellent skiing and snowshoeing in the winter months.</p><p> The Asahel Curtis Nature Trail, named for one of Washington&amp;#39;s most renowned nature photographers, is located nearby.  This trail is a short, easy walk through one of the last remaining stands of old growth forest in the Snoqualmie Valley. The trail crosses Humpback Creek several times before rising gently into a grove of mature Douglas-fir, western hemlock and western red cedar. Mosses, ferns, orchids and a large variety of other wildflowers abound on the forest floor.</p>
