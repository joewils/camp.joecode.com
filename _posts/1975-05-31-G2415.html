sub_title: 'One of the best trails in the entire park, and a shuttle will even bring you back to your car at Logan Pass '
overview: <p>This is one of the park's most beautiful hikes.  It can be done in an afternoon after parking your car at Logan Pass then taking the traverse of the glacially carved valley down to the lower parking lot on Going to the Sun road.  Look up the shuttle schedule and pace yourself so that you can catch a ride with the free shuttle back up to your car at the pass.  </p><p>You'll be stopping a lot for photos and to check out the wildlife but make sure you watch your time as we were forced to literally jog down the trail to make it in time for the shuttle.  For a very relaxing time make sure you have a full day to do the relaxing hike. </p>
tips: <p>Follow the Going to the Sun Road within the national park up to the Logan Pass parking lot.  There is a $25 fee to get into the park per car. </p>
