orientationDescription: <p> This cabin sits at an approximate elevation of 5,300 feet and is situated within a dense conifer forest on the Lick Creek Road just outside of the town of McCall, Idaho.  The Payette National Forest contains some of Idaho&amp;#39;s most beautiful and diverse country.  Located in west-central Idaho, north of Boise, the 2.2 million-acre forest extends 100 miles west to east, from Hells Canyon to the Middle Fork of the Salmon River, and 70 miles north to south, from the Salmon River to the Weiser River. </p>
recreationDescription: <p>Located on the North Fork of Lake Creek this site offers access to mountain bike trails and hiking trails as well as trails easily traversed by horseback.  Your day could take you to one (or more) of the numerous alpine lakes for fishing or swimming.  Peaks and summits nearing the 8,400 foot elevation are within easy riding or walking distance on a day trip.  Visitors interested in kayaking will enjoy the North Fork of Lake Creek downstream to the Little Payette Lake for smallmouth bass or Tiger Muskie fishing. After any of these adventures you can return to the cabin for a well-earned night&amp;#39;s rest.</p>
