sub_title: 'An inviting lake beneath the fearsome north face of one of Washington''s highest and most imposing peaks. '
overview: <p>Stuart Lake is at 5600 feet elevation in the Enchantment Mountain range. It is about a 30 acre lake with clear water and easy fishing access in many places. The lake has a very healthy population of gorgeous cutthroat trout.</p><p>The trail to the lake is well marked and well used. It follows Mountaineer Creek for over 3 miles, at which time you start getting great views of the Enchantment Mountain Range. The elevation gain to Lake Stuart is 1700 feet, but spread out over 5 miles, it really is not a very tough hike.</p><p>Mount Stuart rises above you at the southwest end of the lake with Sherpa Peak to its east.</p><p>You make wish to make a side trip up to Colchuck Lake, but do know that this hike is strenuous, but the payoff is worth it. </p>
tips: <p>Take I-90 and head east over Snoqualmie Pass to Cle Elum, taking the exit to Wenatchee &amp; Blewett Pass via 970 and then US highway 97. Highway 97 takes you over Blewett pass to a junction with U.S. 2. Turn left towards Leavenworth.  From milepost 99 on US 2, on the western end of Leavenworth, follow the paved Icicle Creek Road (Forest Road 76) for 8.4 miles, turn left onto Eightmile Road (FR 7601). Continue on this washboarded dirt road for 3.8 miles to a parking lot and the trailhead.</p><p>You will need a permit if you plan to camp overnight anywhere in the area (you do not need a permit for a day hike beyond the self-issue permit at the trailhead). Failure to have a permit will result in you being fined and asked to leave by the rangers.</p><p>No Dogs are allowed on the trail and no fires are allowed at either lake. </p>
