description: <p>Bannack State Park is a National Historic Landmark and the site of Montana&amp;#39;s first major gold discovery on July 28, 1862. This strike set off a massive gold rush that swelled Bannack&amp;#39;s population to over 3,000 by 1863. As the easy to mine gold steadily dwindled, Bannack&amp;#39;s bustling population slowly declined till no one was left. Over 50 buildings line Main Street; their historic log and frame structures recall Montana&amp;#39;s formative years.</p><p>A walk down the deserted streets of Bannack evokes a feeling of the realities faced in the &amp;#39;Old West.&amp;#39; Bannack is the best preserved of all Montana ghost towns -- being preserved rather than restored, protected rather than exploited.</p><p>Bannack Days, with historic displays, re-enactors, and activities, is held the third weekend in July each year. Tours are conducted from the visitor center, which is open from Memorial Day through Labor Day.</p><p>Bannack has one tipi and two campgrounds; Vigilante and Road Agent offering a total of 24 campsites, 8 of which are available on a first come, first served basis.</p><p> Bannack also has several group day use facilities for special events and occasions.  Inquire with park staff regarding their availability.</p>
