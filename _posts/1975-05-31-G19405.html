sub_title: 'This is the loop at Liberty Lake WA, it does include a side loop of about 4 miles.  '
overview: "<p>&bull; Hike Time: 4:57:44\n&bull; Distance: 11.93 miles\n&bull; Average Pace: 24:58 /mile\n&bull; Fastest Pace: 13:00 /mile\n&bull; Ascent/Descent: 2544 feet\n&bull; Calories: 1748</p><p>Please note: \n- Without the side loop, the Liberty Lake Loop is 8.5 miles.  Count on 3 1/2 to 4 hours. \n- Hiking the loop clockwise (opposite the direction of this guide), you reach the Cedar Grove with a warning sign that the trail is &quot;primitive&quot; beyond that point.  Keep on going, it is a disclaimer sign geared toward the casual day walker/hiker.  The trail is a regular hiking trail beyond that point.  Its not suitable for people out for a stroll in the park, but perfect for hikers.\n- If going early in the spring or late in the fall, when there is a chance of snow in the waterfall area, hike the loop clockwise (opposite the direction of this guide).  The trail up to the waterfalls is steep, so in snow/ice conditions, it is better to be going uphill.  Also, Diamond spikes or similar traction device for boots is recommended - along with a trekking pole.  In snow/ice pack, continue to go up, the probability of injury increases exponentially trying to hike down steep ice covered inclines. </p>"
tips: '<p>If you are using the phone App, go online for web links to park resources. www.everytrail.com</p><p>&bull; This is a moderate trail - should be in fairly good shape to do some sharp uphills and downhills.  Wear liner socks, this is the kind of trail you will get blisters on.  Trekking poles will also come in handy.  Bring extra water, its a trail where you will consume more water than you expect. </p><p>&bull; Dogs: it is a leashed dog trail, but on the &quot;extra&quot; loop you get outside of the county park.  Bring extra treats for dogs, they will burn more energy than you would expect on this trail. </p>'
