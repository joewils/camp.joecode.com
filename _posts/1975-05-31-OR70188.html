note: ''
orientationDescription: <p>Umpqua National Forest visitors are often taken aback by unique and surprising landscapes shaped by explosive geologic events. The 984,602-acre forest provides spectacular scenery and an abundance of natural and cultural resources.</p><p> The translation of the word, &quot;umpqua,&quot; meaning &quot;thundering waters,&quot; defines the area. High mountain lakes, heart-stopping rapids, peaceful ponds and thundering waterfalls, including the 272-foot Watson Falls on the North Umpqua Highway, offer visitors a renewed sense of spirit.</p><p> Diverse ecosystems support a wide range of habitat for wildlife. From eagles and owls to salamanders and salmon, these species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests to live.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Boating, fishing, swimming, kayaking, canoeing and water skiing top the list of recreational activities at the campground. Lemolo Lake provides outdoor enthusiasts with a multitude of recreational opportunities year round.</p><p> The forested shoreline and mountainous backdrop provide a perfect setting for both swimmers braving the lake&amp;#39;s cold, refreshing waters, and for anglers casting lines from boat or beach. Populations of German brown trout, Eastern brook trout, rainbow trout and kokanee salmon thrive in the lake which reaches depths of up to 100 feet in places.</p><p> For waterfall seekers, nearby Lemolo Falls Trail is a steep traverse that drops down into North Umpqua Canyon for a view of Lemolo Falls as it cascades 150 feet to the canyon bottom. A spur trail accesses the bottom of the canyon below the falls.</p>
