sub_title: Via Coleman Glacier with optional ski descent
overview: <p>This is a beautiful climb up one of the most glaciated peaks in the lower 48.  In the summer you will see beautiful wildflowers.   You will camp high up on the Coleman Glacier and make a summit bid early the next morning before the sun comes up.   We found the best place to camp was high on the Coleman Glacier underneath a rocky ridge to climbers right.  Beware of crevasses on this entire hike. </p>
tips: <p>From Bellingham, WA drive east on Rt 542 towards the Mount Baker Ski area.  A mile past the Glacier Public Service Center take a right onto Forest Service Road 39.  Drive 8 miles up this road to the trailhed which is just after the pavement turns to gravel. </p>
