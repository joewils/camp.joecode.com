sub_title: A short biking or dog walking loop in Chip Ross Park just north of the town of Corvallis
overview: <p>This is a short route that is perfect for a short walk (can be a romantic one too!).  It is also a great place to take your dog for some exercise and maybe to chace some deer.  At the top is a truly spectacular tree and you will have some views back over Corvallis.  It doesn't have the great views that Dimple Hill has (see my other guide) but it's a good stroll if you don't have much time. </p>
tips: |-
  <p>Directions to Chip Ross Park:
  Follow 99 north out of town and turn left onto Walnut blvd headed west. Take a right onto Highland and drive about a quarter mile until you see Lester Ave on the left. Take that left and continue to the end of the road to the parking area.  Parking is free. </p>
