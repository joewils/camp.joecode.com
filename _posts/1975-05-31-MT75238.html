recreationDescription: <p>Big game hunting is the primary draw for visitors to the cabin and surrounding wilderness.

Other trailheads are also available in the area.  Visitors also enjoy snowmobiling, cross country skiing and snowshoeing in the area during the winter.

Horses are not allowed in the wilderness area until July 1st each year.
