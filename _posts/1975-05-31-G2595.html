sub_title: Hike downhill through an old growth forest to a camp site and Drift Creek.
overview: <p>This is a really nice hike through old growth trees.  You start at the top and hike all downhill to an old homestead meadow, place to camp, and Drift Creek. </p><p>The hike back is all up hill, but it never gets too steep to be considered difficult. </p>
tips: <p>7.0 miles east of Waldport on Highway 34, turn north on Forest Road 3446 (Risley Creek Road).  After 4.2 miles, fork left onto Forest Road 346.  Continue for 0.3 mile to the trailhead parking lot.</p><p>On a rainy day make sure to wear rain pants as the underbrush and ferns along the trail will soak cotton clothing. </p>
