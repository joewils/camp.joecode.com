title: Mt. Shasta Standard Summit Route
seo_title: mt-shasta-standard-summit-route
sub_title: Via Avalanche Gulch with optional ski descent
overview: <p>An epic two day ascent of a 14,000ft California Volcano.  This is the standard route up from Bunny Flats with an overnight at the campsites near Lake Helen.  From there you ascend up the face and then through Red Banks to Misery Hill (the crappy false summit) and then to the true summit with a return via a ski descent either left or right of &quot;the heart&quot;.  I highly suggest doing this trip as a two day climb to get used to the altitude.  It's a big one! </p>
tips: "<p>Climbers need to obtain a $15 summit permit to climb.  Parking is free.</p><p>Directions: \nFrom Mt. Shasta City off of I-5, drive east on Alma Street to the first stop sign. Turn right and at the next intersection with a blinking red light turn left onto Everitt Memorial Highway. Drive up the highway for 9.5 miles to the junction with the Lower Sand Flat Road. Turn left and travel another 0.8 mile to the junction with the Upper Sand Flat Road. Continue straight ahead for a short distance and take the fork to the right. The road then winds through the timber for 0.4 mile to the trailhead.  There should also be plenty of signs indicating the way. </p>"
