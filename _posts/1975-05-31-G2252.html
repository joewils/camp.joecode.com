sub_title: 'The trail of ten falls is a popular pick for any northwest hiker because of the cluster of unique waterfalls.  '
overview: <p>From the Oregon State Parks Website:</p><p>Nestled in the lower elevation of Oregon's Cascade Mountains lies a temperate rain forest. It is here that the Trail of Ten Falls/Canyon Trail can be found. The Canyon Trail and the falls descend to a forest floor covered with ferns, mosses, and wildflowers. You will also find stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, and cedar. While thousands visit the park every year, it is large enough for you to find quiet places to sit and watch for birds (download a bird list as a text file.)</p><p>The Canyon Trail is a nationally recognized trail system that leads hikers along the banks of the north and south forks of Silver Creek. It takes you to 10 majestic waterfalls, ranging from the grand South Falls (177 feet), to the delicate Drake Falls (27 feet). Four of these falls have an amphitheater-like surrounding where you can walk behind the falls and feel the misty, crisp spray. </p>
tips: <p>Best time to visit is Springtime when the falls are at high flow and the terrain is sturdy. </p><p>No pooches allowed on the lower canyon trail. </p><p>There's a lot more to explore than just waterfalls like the historic ranches and cabins! </p>
