sub_title: 'One of the most popular climbs in the Columbia Gorge with great views of both Mt. Hood and Mt. Adams and the Columbia. '
overview: <p>This is a wonderful climb in teh Columbia Gorge with great views from the many cliffs and ledges near the top of Mt. Hood, Adams and the Columbia River.  There is a side catwalk trail you can take along the way and even a beautiful waterfall with bridge viewpoint.  I don't want to give away too much as being surprised is always better.  Bring a camera! </p>
tips: |-
  <p>Directions:
  Take the Washington State Highway 14 east from Vancouver and take the access road from Mile Post 35 near the Beacon Rock State Park rest area.  This will be open in the summer time but not in the winter.  In the winter you'll need to park at the rest area and it will add nearly a mile round trip to your hike.  Parking is free. </p>
