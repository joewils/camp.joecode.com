importantInformation: '<p> Memaloose is closed from November 1, 2013 until mid-March in 2014. Please note: The maximum stay in Oregon State Parks is 14 nights. OPRD established a reservation procedure through the Oregon Administrative Rules (OARs) to manage occupancy and access to popular campsites, group facilities and alternative camping facilitlies such as yurts and cabins which states: the maximum time allowed within any Oregon State Park is 14 nights within any 17 night period. The site must be physically occupied each night for the remainder of the reservation stay. OAR 736-0100050 section 2 states: A person must comply with seasons, overnight length of stay and camper checkout times. The reason for implementing the policy and rule listed above are to provide everyone the opportunity to utilize popular camping locations at all Oregon State Parks and to not allow individual(s) to set up occupancy for periods of time exceeding two weeks. *Reservations for more than five nights/days that are later changed to fewer nights/days will be charged a fee equal to the nightly/daily site fee for each night/day canceled as well as the $8 transaction fee. Please be aware that only the person whose name is on the reservation may access, change or cancel the reservation. You can stay 14 consecutive nights in a single campground, and may return after spending at least three nights out of the park (it can be another state park campground; in fact, we recommend you DO select another state park campground). The maximum time allowed within any Oregon State Park is 14 nights within any 17 night period. Customers who wish to secure more than one site within a park for a continuous date period in order to accommodate their reservation request (i.e. split reservation), should be aware that the $8.00 reservation fee would apply to each site reserved. Reservation fee adjustments will not be made after reservations have been confirmed using the internet reservation service. If you are viewing inventory and find you are unable to secure one site to accommodate your request please consider calling the call center at 1-800-452-5687 to make your reservation. Discount programs which may be offered through the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department cannot be processed when making an internet reservation. For additional information on discount programs call the OPRD Information Center at 1-800-551-6949 or visit us online at www.OregonStateParks.org. Reservations can be made 24 hours a day, from 2 days to 9 months in advance. Campsite availability is based on call center hours, meaning sites become available when the call center opens. Call center hours are: Monday through Friday 8am to 5pm. </p>'
