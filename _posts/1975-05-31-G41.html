sub_title: 'Elephant seal watching at A&ntilde;o Nuevo State Reserve; learn about fascinating sex lives of gigantic marine mammals '
overview: '<p>The elephant seals at A&ntilde;o Nuevo State Reserve are not pretty, but they live pretty well. In fact, they''re living out one of the world''s greatest escapes from extinction.</p><p>Things have been getting better for the elephant seals of the Pacific Coast in the century since humans stopped slaughtering them: Their population has recovered from hundreds to over a hundred thousand.</p><p>Now thousands of northern elephant seals come to A&ntilde;o Nuevo and a few other beaches in California and Mexico to breed. Watching their reproductive antics is one of the best wildlife experiences available in California -- the closest you''re likely to come to any large mammals as they go about their business of making babies.</p><p>You''ll be amazed at how many of elephant seals fill A&ntilde;o Nuevo at the height of the season. It''ll look like a seal civilization, and you can learn all their laws on the guided tours. </p>'
tips: "<p>Elephant seals are immense, dangerous wild animals (an adult male weighs as much as your car). Never approach and always give them lots of space.</p><p>Sand walking can wear you out if you're not used to it. The beach walking makes a four-mile hike feel like a six-miler.</p><p>Watch for poison oak along narrow sections of trail.</p><p>Park hours:\nApril 1-Aug. 31: 8 a.m.-5 p.m. \nSept. 1-Nov 30: 8 a.m.-4 p.m.\nDec. 1-14: Seal area closed</p><p>What to bring:\nWindbreaker and layers -- it can be quite cold at the beach, especially in winter.\nShoes suited to walking on sand\nDrinking water\nBinoculars and cameras\nCash for parking fee </p>"
