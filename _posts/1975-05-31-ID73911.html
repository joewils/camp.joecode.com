description: <p>This site was originally established as Deer Park Ranger Guard Station in 1913, and a cabin was built here in 1917. This cabin, along with many others in Boise National Forest, was replaced in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Deer Park Cabin looks much the same today as it did in the 1930s.</p><p>The cabin is available from mid-May through late September, and it&amp;#39;s easily accessible by car in good weather. Many creature comforts are provided, but guests may need to bring additional gear and supplies to have a comfortable and enjoyable stay.</p>

Go straight ahead on Road #348 for 1/4 mile where you will see a meadow in front of you and a lower standard road turning off to the right. This road will lead you to Deer Park Cabin, about 300 yards in.</p>'

orientationDescription: <p>Deer Park Cabin is located in an open meadow lined with mature Ponderosa pines at an approximate elevation of 4,400 feet. Nearby, the North Fork Boise River rushes over rocks and through jagged granite walls studded with pine trees.</p><p>Wildlife watchers may want to look for deer and elk. Bears are occasional visitors to the area as well. A variety of waterfowl is attracted to the river, as well as bald eagles and osprey.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The North Fork Boise River Trail, which begins directly behind the cabin, leads hikers upstream. The 5-mile trail passes through some of the roughest, most scenic canyon walls in Idaho before dipping down to the river&amp;#39;s edge to pass by a rock bluff.</p><p>Horse Heaven Trail begins about a mile from the cabin and connects with the Swanholm/Warrior Trails. All these trails are open to hikers, horseback riders, mountain bikers, dirt bikers and motorcyclists, although some of the sections of the trail may be particularly difficult for motorcycles.

Big game hunting is also a popular pastime in the area.</p>
