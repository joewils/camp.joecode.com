sub_title: Take this service road around the Cabell Marsh to see a variety of wildfowl
overview: <p>This is one of the best walks in the refuge and unless the marsh is frozen you are pretty much gauranteed to see some widlife.  Keep an eye out for egrets, ducks, eagles, ospreys, herons and songbirds along the trail.  If you have time it is great to combine this trip with the Memorial Boardwalk as well which I have another guide for.   </p>
tips: <p>From Corvallis Follow Hwy 99 south for about 8.5 miles from Avery Ave until you see the Refuge Road on the right. Take that road and drive a few miles down the gravel road past the headquarters. You'll drive across open meadows up on a hill then down and around a bend.  When you pass a red barn on your right immediately take the next left to the parking area.  I've included a photo of the sign marking the road in the first POI of this guide. </p>
