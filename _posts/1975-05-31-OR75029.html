description: <p>Warner Mountain Lookout is the winter wonderland destination for avid winter sports enthusiasts looking for a challenge. This replica of an old cupola-style lookout  sits on a high vantage point of Warner Ridge at an altitude of 5,300 feet in the Willamette National Forest approximately 75 miles southeast of Eugene, Oregon.</p><p>This is a very remote location. The journey to the tower can be long, up to 10 miles on foot, and risky as the wind and snow whips across the ridge. Experience in  cross-country skiing or snowshoe travel is highly recommended.</p><p>The reward is worth the effort of getting there. Guests will enjoy panoramic views of the pristine snow-covered landscape and starry skies on clear nights.</p>
drivingDirection: <p>From Eugene, Oregon, take I-5 south to the exit for Highway 58 East. Drive east 34 miles on Highway 58 through Oakridge. Continue on Highway 58 about 1 to 1.5 miles east of Oakridge. Turn right towards Hills Creek Reservoir on Kitson Springs Road and proceed 0.2 mile to Forest Service Road (FSR) 21. Turn right and follow double lane FSR 21 south and southeast for approximately 18 miles. Turn left on gravel FSR 2129.  Proceed on 2129 for 8 miles to Spur 439.  (You may encounter snow before you reach 439).   Turn right at this junction; follow this road for 4 miles to the 342 spur on the left.  This is the road to the lookout. The road is gated. Lookout signs along FSR 21 and FSR 2129 will help identify the routes. Orange poles identify the final route through a meadow to the lookout.  If a low-elevation storm is predicted at the time of arrival, be sure to park vehicle facing downhill before reaching the snow zone. It is the responsibility of cabin guests to arrange for towing if their vehicle gets stuck in snow.</p>
facilitiesDescription: <p>The 14x14-ft. cabin sits atop a 40-foot tower and is surrounded by a catwalk. The cabin accommodates 4 people and is furnished with one double bed that comfortably sleeps two, a table and chairs, propane stoves for heating and cooking, cookware, dishes, broom and a 2-way radio for emergency use.</p><p>  There is an outhouse nearby.</p><p> No water or electricity is provided. Guests typically melt snow for their supply of water for drinking, cooking and washing. A large pot is provided for this purpose.</p><p>  Items such as bedding, extra mattresses, flashlights, matches, extra toilet paper, first aid supplies, trash bags, dish soap, and towels are not reliably available after mid-season. Guests are expected to pack out their trash and clean the cabin before leaving.</p>
