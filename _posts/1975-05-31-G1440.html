title: Mt. Bailey Standard Summit Route
seo_title: mt-bailey-standard-summit-route
sub_title: Via Diamond Lake and Southeast Ridge with optional ski descent
overview: <p>A fairly easy ski ascent and descent of a fun peak near Crater Lake.  This ascent follows snowmobile tracks for a good portion before heading into the woods and then finally up a southeast ridge to the bare summit.  Cat ski operations are on this mountain so you may see other skiers but you'll know that you're more of a man/woman for earning your turns than the people who get their butts escorted to the top...  At the top you'll have an awesome view of Mt. Thielsen over Diamond Lake. </p>
tips: <p>From route 138 turn onto Route 230 near Diamond Lake and continue down the road until the first road on your right.  There will be a small parking lot most likely filled with snowmobile trailers.  This is your start.  A Snow permit or Northwest Forest Pass is needed here.  Also, if you were smart enough to buy a couple 6-packs of beer you may be able to trade them for a tow in or tow out... keep that in mind. </p>
