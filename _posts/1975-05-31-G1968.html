sub_title: 'Enjoy an easy hike through the Cascade foothills to a beautiful set of waterfalls, only 30 minutes from downtown Seattle '
overview: <p>This popular trail follows the South Fork of the Snoqualmie River through the rainforests along the western edge of the Cascade Mountains. The trail provides spectacular views of Twin Falls. Most people park at the Twin Falls Trailhead located off of Exit 34 on I-90. A little over a mile from the trailhead, a set of stairs descends to a viewpoint of the Lower Falls as they plunge over a 150 foot cliff. Hike another quarter mile to a bridge that spans the narrow Twin Falls canyon. From the bridge you can see several plunge pools of the Upper Falls upstream and the edge of the Lower Falls downstream. Less than a quarter mile from the bridge is a view of the Upper Falls from above. Most visitors turn around at this point as the trail starts climbing steeply. Those hearty enough to continue will find that, the trail intersects with the John Wayne Pioneer Trail in a little under a mile. The John Wayne Pioneer Trail is a 108 mile long trail that follows the old Chicago-Milwaukee-St. Paul-Pacific Railroad from Cedar Falls to Vantage. Hike east along the Pioneer Trail for a quarter mile to reach the Olallie State Park Homestead Valley Trailhead (located off I-90 Exit 38). </p>
