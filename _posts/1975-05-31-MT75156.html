description: <p>Medicine Point Lookout is a historic tower located on Medicine Point, west of Sula.

On clear nights the lights of Hamilton can be seen from the tower.</p><p>The Bitterroot forest is home to many species of wildlife, from mule deer, whitetail deer, elk, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, black bear, mountain lions and moose to many varieties of smaller animals and birds.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>An extensive trail system exists in the area, including several loop trails for hiking, backpacking and horseback riding. Hitching racks are available at the base of the tower for equestrian campers&amp;#39; needs. Road and trail conditions are unpredictable, as weather changes quickly in the area.

A lookout journal is kept inside, providing instructions of what to do in case of emergency or a storm. Danger from lightning is largely abated due to a lightning rod implanted at the structure.</p>
