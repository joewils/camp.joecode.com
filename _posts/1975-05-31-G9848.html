sub_title: 6.2 mile trail run Ogden, Utah
overview: "<p>R-Scape 18 hours of Ogden Race Course is about 6.2 miles long and located near Ogden, Utah. The trail is great for trail running, Mt. Biking, Hiking, dog friendly, and normally takes 1-3 hours.</p><p>The best trails, combining the upper/lower Bonneville Shoreline Trail in Ogden, designed by R-Scape, 18 hrs. of Ogden Utah. \nIf you are looking for a trail run that is both challenging and fun this is the one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been running the upper/lower Bonneville Shoreline Trail in Ogden for over 3years. Recently a friend told me about a trail race put on by R-Scape, 18 hours of Ogden. I then checked out the race course on-line. I had run both the upper and lower trails many times and though I had run every variation imaginable. I was wrong. It took me a number of runs, referencing the website (with Google earth) and reading others runner&rsquo;s blogs to get the course down. It is now one of my favorite training run in that area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The climb out of Mt. Ogden Park, through the trees, then onto the flat fire-road beneath the golf course is an excellent warm-up. Out the parking lot onto the road. Left thru the gait onto Strongs Canyon/maintenance road just before the Weber Maintenance building. A quick climb 1/4 way up the Strongs Canyon/maintenance road, quick left, over the bridge, and a very fast and engaging descent to Weber state.&nbsp; Take a right just before the Weber State bus stop. Then comes a climb, then climb, then a climb. This is where you need to dig deep if you want to get up quick. The climb eventually levels out while you follow the ridgeline with little variation in elevation. Waterfall Canyon is the first canyon you cross. Cross the bride, out again. Notice the wooden pipes wrapped in coils, always wondered the history. You will hang a left and run until just before you get to Strongs Canyon. Turn around and backtracked to where Waterfall canyon meets the trail you were just on. Take a hard left and bomb down what I believe they call &ldquo;The Bobsled&rdquo; or &quot;Luge&quot;. It is a sandy flume shaped descent that you can let loose on. You will then take a left on the trail just above the new water tower until you cross the bride at the midway point in Strongs canyon/Maintenance road. Up the new trail and loop to the right and take a left onto Strongs Canyon/maintenance road the utility road. Left on to a small trail that will then again shoot you across Strongs Canyon/maintenance road and through two iron barriers to discourage motor vehicles. Wind around staying left and you are back to the parking lot that you excited from the fire-road. Back onto the fire-road below the golf course. Back track the way you came from Mt. Ogden Park only stay to the right and follow the trail back to your starting point. Enjoy. </p>"
tips: |-
  <p>You can Trail Run, Bike, Hike, take your dog.
  Summer: Stay hydrated. Have Fun.
  Winter: Wear some type of traction as the trail is well traveled sometimes causing a smooth and eveny icy conditions Wear something aggressive. I personally use Kahtoola MICROspikest and never have had a problem. Run at your own risk and be careful especially in waterfall canyon.  </p>
