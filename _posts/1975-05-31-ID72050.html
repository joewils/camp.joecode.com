description: <p>Kelly Forks Cabin is located within the Kelly Forks compound, an active Forest Service Work Center. It is believed to have been built in the mid-1930s, and was  originally used as a stopover between the Upper North Fork and the Bungalow Ranger Station.</p><p>Peak season at the cabin is from mid-June through the end of September. It is accessible by car, but the last 31 miles of the drive are on narrow dirt roads that may  be rocky and rutted.</p><p>The cabin provides many modern comforts, including electricity and indoor plumbing. Guests only need to bring a few of their own amenities to have a comfortable and  enjoyable stay.</p>
drivingDirection: '<p>The cabin is approximately 48 miles northeast of the community of Pierce, Idaho. The last 31 miles to the cabin are narrow, have a dirt-surface and may be peppered with large ruts and rocks, so travel can be slow-going. Kelly Forks Cabin is also situated about 54 miles southwest of Superior, Montana.   From Lewiston, Idaho:  Travel 45 miles west on U.S. Highway 12 to the bridge at Orofino, Idaho.

orientationDescription: <p>The cabin sits in a small clearing surrounded by evergreen trees near the beautiful North Fork of the Clearwater River, a free-flowing river where trees and brush grow on the steep hillsides rising from the water&amp;#39;s edge. Kelly Creek, known worldwide as a premium fishery for Westslope cutthroat trout, is just a stone&amp;#39;s throw from the cabin.</p><p>Elk, white-tailed and mule deer, black bear, cougar, mountain goat and moose call this area home. They mostly roam at night but can occasionally be seen in the  daytime.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Kelly Creek, a tributary of the North Fork of the Clearwater River, is one of Clearwater National Forest&amp;#39;s popular fishing streams. Kelly Creek and all of its  tributaries are protected by special regulations that allow catch-and-release fishing only. These rules are designed to preserve valued fly-fishing streams.</p><p>The North Fork of the Clearwater is popular for swimming and tubing. In the summer, guests can pick wild berries that grow in the vicinity. Other recreational activities in the area include hiking, horseback riding and mountain biking. Trail access is less than a mile from the cabin.</p>
