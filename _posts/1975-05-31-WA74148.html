orientationDescription: <p>The Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest is defined by its diverse landscapes, boasting high, glaciated alpine peaks, lush valleys of old-growth forest and rugged shrub-steppe country.</p><p>Nestled in a subalpine forest, the area surrounding the cabin is home to abundant wildlife, including deer, squirrels and migratory birds. Endangered and threatened species, including the northern spotted owl and gray wolf, also find havens in nearby ecosystems.</p><p>Mount Stuart, a towering mass of granite located in the nearby Alpine Lakes Wilderness, can be seen from the area. At an elevation of 9,415 feet, it is the second highest non-volcanic peak in Washington. Its steep summit stands out among its neighboring peaks.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>In addition to being a prime location for hiking, fishing, horseback riding and mountain biking in summer and early fall, guests can take advantage of skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling in the winter months.</p><p>Table Mountain, with its high elevation and great distance from cities and light pollution, is revered by West Coast astronomers as a stargazing paradise. Every summer, hundreds of astronomers flock to the area in the early part of August to attend the Table Mountain Star Party.</p><p>Hikers may enjoy Naneum Meadows Trail, which is less than three miles from the cabin. This loop links lush meadows, cliff-top views and scores of wildflowers in the summer months. In the winter, trail users should have knowledge of avalanche safety, as well as route finding and ski mountaineering skills.</p>
