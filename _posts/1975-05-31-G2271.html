sub_title: ''
overview: <p>This hike is probably one of the most beautiful hikes in the area</p><p>The 1st half is an easy hike along the beach, after you pass the whole in the wall it becomes more of a rocky hike where you may need to use your hands to get pass the rocks. The rocks can be slippery unless you walk close to the wall to your right.</p><p>You can camp at the first stop if you are running low on daylight, but there is a better camp spot around the second piece of land going into the sea.</p><p>There's not too much drift wood since the many campers going there use it all, but you may be able to collect enough for a small fire. </p>
tips: |-
  <p>Careful with the tides.
  You need to get a permit to camp by the beach.
  There's limited fresh water. Check with the ranger for fresh water sources along the way.
  Check the weather before you go. It rains a lot in the area </p>
