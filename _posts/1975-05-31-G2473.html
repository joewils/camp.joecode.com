overview: |-
  <p>The Willamette Valley seduces not only those of us who call this place home but also those adventurers who have heard tales of her siren call. Verdant hills with rows of lustrous grapevines marching from peak to vale, mint-green fields, stately firs spiring skyward, and a passion for stewardship of the valley's natural abundance create our legendary &quot;green&quot; reputation. From Eugene's innovative urban landscape to Springfield's historic district to the close-knit communities of Cottage Grove, Junction City, Veneta, Coburg, Creswell and Lowell, this region beckons those who seek the Pacific Northwest experience.
  In both city and countryside you will want to savor our justly-renowned pinots, stroll the farmers' markets bright with seasonal bounty, and rub shoulders with artists who derive much inspiration from their surroundings. Enjoy the sweet sensation of cycling along bikeways that follow the riffling Willamette River, through diverse wetland birding habitat, gardens and parks. Bring your clubs for a leisurely round of golf at one of our in-town courses or play a quick 9 holes followed by tastings at a few Wineries of Lane County.</p><p>Lane County rests at the southern end of the Willamette Valley, which extends from Cottage Grove north to West Linn, and lies nestled between the Coast and Cascade mountain ranges.</p><p>Oregon Wine Country is the place to visit for additional information on this fertile environment, and the Oregon Wine Board has the latest on wineries throughout the state. For a look at the Willamette Valley region from a wider perspective, you simply must Travel Oregon. We've fallen hard for Willamette Valley's many charms, and we know you will too! </p>
tips: <p>Oregon Route 58 begins (at its western terminus) at an interchange with Interstate 5 and Oregon Route 99 near Goshen, located between the cities of Eugene and Creswell. It heads due southeast from there, following the course of the Willamette River into the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. The highway passes several lakes, including Dexter Lake and Lookout Point Lake, and provides access to the town of Lowell. Further into the mountains, it passes through the cities of Oakridge and Westfir. It continues into the mountains, to the summit of Willamette Pass, after which it descends into central Oregon. Oregon Route 58 terminates at an interchange with U.S. Route 97.</p><p>Two scenic byways&mdash;the West Cascades Scenic Byway and the Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway&mdash;intersect with OR 58. </p>
