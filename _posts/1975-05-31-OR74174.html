description: <p>Ditch Creek Guard Station, located about 27 miles southeast of Heppner, Oregon, is a cozy little cabin that accommodates six overnight guests, plus additional guests camped in a tent outside. Equestrian campers are welcome and a corral is provided.</p><p>  The guard station was originally built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s. It is a classic example of forest building structures of that era and is eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.</p><p> Wintertime brings opportunities for snowmobiling and cross country skiing. These modes of transportation are necessary for accessing the cabin in winter.</p>
