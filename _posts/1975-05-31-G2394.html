sub_title: From the Cascade Lakes Highway to the top of the tallest Sister in a day.
overview: <p>This is a beautiful ski descent of the tallest Sister in the Sister Wilderness at just over 10,000 feet in elevation.  You'll climb nearly 5,000 feet of vertical so make sure your legs are ready.  You'll be able to skin up most of the way until it gets too steep for your skins to hold.  You will also have great views of North and South Sister, Broken Top and Jefferson in the distance. </p>
tips: <p>Note - From the track you can see my batteries ran out in my gps from the cold top to about half way down the face. my suggestion would be to ski the broad slopes of the ascent track on your way down and head back towards the little lake you passed on the way up.  Then follow your ascent route back to your vehicle below.</p><p>Directions.  From Bend drive up the Cascade Lakes Highway until you get just past Devils Lake.  Look for trail signs around Tyee Creek at the west end of the lake.  Head up from there.  The road is usually first plowed around Memorial Day weekend. </p>
