sub_title: A beautiful waterfall in the coastal range.
overview: <p>This is a short hike deep in the coastal range that brings you to an amazing waterfall and a very high and long suspension bridge.  You may lose gps signal deep in the forest but the trail is very clear.  You'll have a choice to take a loop trail on the way back to make the hike a little longer which is what this track shows. </p>
tips: |-
  <p>Trailhead Directions:
  North of Depoe Bay on Highway 101 you'll pass by the Salishan golf course.  Turn right just past this onto Drift Creek Road.  Follow this a quarter mile, then angle right on South Drift Creek Road.  Turn left onto Forest Service Road 17 and drive up the road for 10 miles to the trailhead. </p>
