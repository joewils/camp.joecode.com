orientationDescription: <p>The campground is situated on the southeastern shore of the roughly 1,400-acre lake, at an elevation of 3,400 feet. Timothy Lake was created in 1950 as a storage reservoir for the Oak Grove Hydroelectric Project. It is one of the larger lakes in the Mt. Hood National Forest.</p><p>The campground is nestled in a mixed conifer forest, with many sites at the water&amp;#39;s edge, offering views of Mt. Hood. A thick understory of rhododendron bushes provide privacy between sites.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Proximity to Timothy Lake allows campers to enjoy a variety of water-related recreation, including boating and sailing, as well as swimming, windsurfing and fishing. Anglers can expect a catch of kokanee salmon and a variety of trout, as well as crayfish.</p><p> A variety of trails are located in the area. The Timothy Lake Trail is popular for hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding. The 11.6 miles of relatively level terrain loops trekkers around the lake, providing scenic views of the area. It connects to the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, a lengthy hike that extends across three states, from the borders of Canada and Mexico. Portions of that trail also lead southwest to Clackamas Lake Campground and a historic site.</p><p>The Clackamas Lake Ranger Station Historic District is less than 5 miles from the campground. It was built to house forest service workers in the early 1900s. The rustic architecture and historic nature of the buildings and the surrounding area draws thousands of tourists each year.</p>
