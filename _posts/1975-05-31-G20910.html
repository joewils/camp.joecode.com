sub_title: 'Specifically for hiking to the top of Mt. Spokane in MAY-JUNE, while the north side trails are still SNOW covered. '
overview: |-
  <p>NOTE: There is another guide for hiking to the top July through October.</p><p>&bull; Hike Time: 4:20:28
  &bull; Distance: 11 miles
  &bull; Ascent: 1377 feet
  &bull; Descent: 1376 feet
  &bull; Calories: 1387</p><p>&bull; The actual hike time and distance will differ, I ended up doing some switch backs - plus, had to retrace my steps at one point to retrieve the dogs water bottle that had fallen off the pack.  </p><p>&bull; In May-June, this is a nice hike to get back into hiking shape and get some sun.</p><p>&bull; Mt. Spokane is a fee area, a Washington State Parks Discover Pass is required - $30 annual or $10 for single day use.  The State Parks no longer receive any of your tax dollars, their operations are financed by fees.  This includes just driving into the parks, for example to drive to the top of Mt. Spokane.  There is a $99 fine for not having a Discover Pass. </p>
tips: <p>If you are using the phone App, go online for web links to park resources, trail video, and 360&ordm; panorama interactive photos. www.everytrail.com</p><p>&bull; On this trip, watch out for mountain bikers.  Going up from the CCC Cabin you are on trails/roads that are favorites of mountain bikers.  Of course, hiking during weekdays or early in the mornings mitigate this.  </p><p>&bull; The entire Mt. Spokane State Park is dog leashed area.  You can get a $75 fine for having your dog off leash.  I have come across moose, glad the dog was on a leash - don't need him pissing off a moose!!!  You probably don't want to know the fine and potential jail time penalties for you dog chasing wildlife. </p>
