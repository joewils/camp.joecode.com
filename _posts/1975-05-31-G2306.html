sub_title: This easy hike most famous for it's amazing wildflower meadows is best done in the spring.
overview: <p>In earlier days, a fire lookout, consisting of a platform on a topped tree and a three-sided shelter on the ground, was located on the large, flat top.  Now the trail is best known for it's wildflower meadows.</p><p>The trail crosses several steep sloped meadows located below rocky outcrops. These provide good views toward the southeast. Wildflowers grow profusely on the top and in the meadows. </p><p>Best time to hike is early to mid June. </p>
tips: <p>From Eugene/Springfield, drive east on Highway 58 to the Westfir exit directly across the Middle Fork Ranger District station. Drive 0.5 mile, crossing the Middle Fork of the Willamette River, and turn left at the stop sign. In another 1.7 miles you will come to a second stop sign, with a covered bridge on your left. Proceed straight on Road 19 for approximately 4.6 miles, and turn left onto gravel Forest Road 1912 for 6.8 miles.  Go straight on Road 1910 for .3 miles and fork right onto Road 1911 for .4 miles to the Alpine Trail sign on your left.</p><p>If you go on this hike in the spring please take photos of the wildflowers and upload them to Everytrail so we can add pictures to this guide.  If you do please leave a review to this guide so I know to update it. </p>
