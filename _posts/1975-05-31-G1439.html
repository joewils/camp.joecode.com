sub_title: Via Corrigan Lake and the Northwest Ridge with optional ski descent
overview: <p>This is a truly amazing ski descent on a less traveled Oregon Volcano.  The Ascent is straightforward through the trees.  The GPS track in this guide does not follow the trail which at the time was buried under feet of snow.  It was however the most direct and easy ski ascent.  When you get to 7,000 feet you'll you have the choice of going left or right around what looks above to be the summit.  We chose right which led us to a steep ridge and a couple tricky traverses across steep snow slopes.  The other choice would be to go to the left around which is a little longer but far easier and will also serve as your ski descent route.  There are lots of ski options in this trip for all abilities but as usual make sure the snow conditions are safe. </p>
tips: <p>From Oakridge drive south on Highway 58 a mile and turn right onto Forest Service Road 21 (Rigdon Road).  This road makes a right in a half mile following along the Hills Creek Reservoir.  Continue on this road for a long 30 miles to Forest Service Road 2149.  Take a left onto this road and follow it as far as you can or until you reach the Corrigan Lake Trail at 5 miles. </p>
