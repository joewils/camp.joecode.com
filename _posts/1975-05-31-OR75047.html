description: <p>Hilltop Hideaway is an old Forest Service cabin that allows guests to relax in the outdoors and also step back in time to when the cabin was used during bygone gold mining days. The cabin is part of the Fremont Powerhouse complex, a hub for mining built in the early 1900s. It is one of four cabins located at the site near the town of Granite, and provides great flexibility for larger groups.</p><p>The surrounding valleys once teemed with mining activity, primarily gold. The Fremont Powerhouse was built in 1908 as an economical method for mining. Two dams were constructed at Olive Lake, and water from the lake was piped through an 8-mile wood and steel pipeline to the powerhouse to generate electricity. Homes were constructed to shelter workers who monitored the pipeline. Today, these same shelters are where visitors can stay overnight.</p><p>Hilltop Hideaway is furthest uphill from the Fremont Powerhouse. Winter access may require skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles.</p>
drivingDirection: <p>From Pendleton, travel south on Highway 395 for 50 miles to the Ukiah exit. Turn left on Highway 244 to Ukiah. Take Forest Road 52 from Ukiah city center, and drive 50 miles to the small town of Granite. From Granite, go west on County Road 24 for approximately 6 miles. The main road veers left along the creek bed. At this junction go uphill on FR 10 and follow the signs to the Fremont Powerhouse.  In winter, access to FR 10 may require snowmobiles, cross country skis, snowshoes or 4-wheel drive, depending on weather conditions. The closest plowed road comes within 1.2 miles of the cabin. Please call the district office for road conditions.</p>

A picnic table and briquette grill is provided out back for outdoor barbecuing. Additional guests can pitch tents in the yard.

The kitchen is equipped with an electric stove and oven, refrigerator, coffee maker, toaster and a variety of cooking utensils like skillets, glasses, cups and silverware.
