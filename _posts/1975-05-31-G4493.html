sub_title: Eugene's most popular and iconic Butte, with the best view of Eugene/Springfield in the area.
overview: <p>This hike is the most popular in Eugene.  Take your choice of trails through Douglas fir trees.  At the top you will find a rocky outcroping with views all up and down the Willamette Valley.</p><p>The butte was called Champ-a te or Cham-o-tee by the native Kalapuya, meaning rattlesnake.</p><p>One popular theory is that Spencer Butte was named for a young Englishman of the Hudson's Bay Company named Spencer, who was said to have been killed by the Kalapuya after climbing the hill alone. Another, less popular theory holds that the butte was named after Secretary of War John C. Spencer in July 1845 by Elijah White. Spencer was no longer Secretary of War by 1845, however.</p><p> </p>
tips: '<p>To get here from downtown Eugene take Willamette Street south.  You will find the trailhead listed at POI #6  fist just past 52nd street.</p><p>The main trailhead POI #1 is further south and you will find a sign on your left with the parking lot. </p>'
