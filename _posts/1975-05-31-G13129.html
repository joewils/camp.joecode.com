sub_title: 'Hike in to Duffy one of Oregon''s great swimming lakes at the base of Three Fingered Jack.  Side trip to Red Butte. '
overview: <p>Duffy Lake &amp; Red Butte is about 12.7 miles long and located near Marion Forks, Oregon. The trail is great for hiking and normally takes a full day.</p><p>Trail up to Duffy Lake is pretty easy, with one stream crossing that was simple as well, although I hear at times it can get a bit deep in early spring.View at Duffy Lake is amazing, the water is a bit cold but great to swim in (I'm guessing perfect temp wise by August).&nbsp; We camped on the West end of the lake and had a choice view of Three Fingered Jack.&nbsp; We did a bit of fishing and caught and released some German Brown trout.The mosquito's were hell at the campground.&nbsp; This has been a late snow melt off year so I'm guessing the mosquito level is what you would normally find in late June.&nbsp; Make sure you have repellent.The next day we hiked up to Duffy Butte.&nbsp; There isn't a trail so you will have to scramble up yourself.&nbsp; From the top you get amazing views of Three Fingered Jack, Mt. Jefferson, Mt. Washington, North &amp; Middle Sister, and Broken Top.We scrambled back down and ate some lunch before taking off for Mowich Lake and to summit Red Butte.&nbsp; The hike is through a 2003 forest fire so bring pleanty of sunscreen and lots of water.Just before the trailess scramble up to Red Butte you will come across little Alice Lake.&nbsp; A good place to water up before heading up.&nbsp; Really nice views of the same mountains I mentioned before as well as Jorn Lake and the 8 Lake Basin to the North.Overall great backpacking trip. </p>
tips: <p>To get here drive 76 miles east of Salem on Hwy 22 (or 6 miles north of the Santiam &quot;Y,&quot;) the turnoff for the trailhead is to the East Big Meadows Road 2267 for about 3 miles and follow a sign to the left when the pavement ends. A turnaround loop is at the end of the road. This is a fee-use area for parking. Free wilderness permits are also required and are available at the trailhead kiosk, and a toilet is available in the parking area.</p><p>Bring mosquito repellent, and lots of it. </p>
