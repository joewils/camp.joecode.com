seo_title: loon-lake-loop
sub_title: 'A popular hiking, mountain biking, horse backing, and dirt bike trail from Chinook Campground-Loon Lake-Ruby Meadows TH. '
overview: <p>Hikers/walkers usually start from Chinook Campground and loop across the campground bridge to Loon Lake and return over the CCC Bridge and up the Secesh River. It is about 10 miles round trip. It is about a mile, either way, to the bomber crash site from the Loon Lake outlet.</p><p>Hikers/walkers also hike to the Dredge Pond/Ruby Meadows area from the Ruby Meadows Trail Head. It is about 5 miles round trip.</p><p>Mountain bikers commonly leave one vehicle at one of the trail heads and ferry to the other trail head to start the ride.</p><p>It is about a 22 mile round trip for horse back riders riding from the Ruby Meadows Trail Head to Loon Lake.</p><p>Ruby Meadows is an ATV trail head, but the trail is only open for about five miles one way. </p>
tips: '<p>Depending on the seasons'' snowfall, the trails are usually clear by July and open through September, sometimes a little longer. It gets cold in October.</p><p>Clothing depends on the weather, but it usually freezes at night all summer. Thunder storms are possible at any time.</p><p>Take drinking water with you as none of the ground water in this area is safe to drink without filtering or boiling.</p><p>Wild animals, including moose, elk, deer, bear, wolves, cougars, river otters, pine marten, and others are in the area. I have seen both moose and river otters in Loon Lake and at the Chinook Campground in the river. Salmon usually arrive in the middle of August. This is also &quot;Bear Country&quot;.</p><p>Be aware that wolves are very territorial and may attack any dogs with you. Moose cows with calves may attack anything. Don''t push your luck with moose!</p><p>Read and abide by the information at the trail heads on how to interact with horses and pack stock you may encounter.</p><p>There is no cell phone service in the area.</p><p>Contact the McCall Ranger Station, Payette National Forest, Idaho, telephone #208 634-0400 for maps, fire info, and camp ground availability. </p>'
