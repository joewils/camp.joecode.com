title: Bagley Seam Trail
seo_title: bagley-seam-trail
sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.
overview: <p>The official trail may only be .2 miles long but to get to this trail you will have to hike in using one of two different routes, via Red Town Trail or Wildside Trail. The total distance travelled round trip will be about 3/4 of a mile from the Red Town parking area.</p><p>This trail is a nice part of the coal mining history that can be found at Cougar Mountain. On this trail you can see and touch an actual coal vein, better known as Bagley Seam for which the trail is named after.  From either direction you come from you will come across the seam near the half way point in the trail. It can be difficult to spot if you are hiking this trail in the fall when large maple leaves cover the ground.  To help guide you, there is a large fallen tree on the trail and you will have to step over its stump to continue on the trail. This stump serves as a marker for the Bagley Seam.  Look to the other side of the stump, about 1 foot above the trail, and you will see the black coal protruding from the rock.</p><p>This is the only attraction to see on this short trail but it does tie in with the mining history of the area. If you are hiking these trails to learn more about the areas coal mining history I would suggest hiking this trail in addition with; Rainbow Town Trail, Steam Hoist Trail, Red Creek Trail, and the Coal Creek Trails.  Together these trails will provide you with a relatively easy hike that can be completed by nearly everyone.</p><p>If you are looking for a challenging trail run this short trail would be a great trail to start on. It is short but technical as there are many slippery rocks and stumps to traverse.  The incline of the trail is also steep and will offer a challenge to beginner trail runners. </p>
