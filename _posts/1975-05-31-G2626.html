sub_title: An easy 2-mile trek to the lake with great camping options
overview: <p>Off of the Waldo Highway, this is an easy trek around 2 miles to the lake. It is great lake to take a casual hike to.  This is a good trip for a two day camping excursion.. You can hike around the lake. The Pacific Crest Trail follows along the North side of the lake. There is a trail on the South side of the lake but it is not in the best condition. There is also a large Rock outcrop you will need to negotiate on the West side. </p><p>To get to the Trailhead from Eugene, take I5 South to Oregon State Highway 58 going east.  You will pass by Lowell lake, Lookout Resevior, Oakridge (35 miles from I5)  15 miles east of Oakridge take a left onto Waldo Lake Road (#5897) About 5 miles up the road on the right is the Bobby Trailhead sign. </p>
tips: <p>I believe the best time to hike to this lake is mid August to September.  Anytime before this, you will be inundated with Mosquitoes. I would still bring plenty of bug juice just in case. </p>
