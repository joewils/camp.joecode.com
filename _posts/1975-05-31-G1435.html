sub_title: Via Green Lakes and Northwest Ridge
overview: <p>On this hike we took the long route around Broken Top past Green Lakes to ascend the complete Northwest Ridge and then return via a loop trail to the lakes on the descent.  To be honest we had trouble finding the shorter trail up on the way and ended up climbing the whole ridge.  A shorter option would be to follow the shorter route up to where it meets the ridge and continue from there.  The upper part of the ridge is extremely steep and exposed.  Many suggest using a rope and using protection.  Do this, especially if you have any fear of heights.  We did it without ropes.  On the return definitely take the trail directly down from the ridge to Green Lakes as it will save time.  The rocks on the summit are some of the most beautiful I've ever seen on a climb.  Bring a rugged camera. </p>
tips: <p>Start from the Green Lakes/Fall Creek Trailhead.  To get there drive west on the Cascade Lakes Highway 24 miles then turn onto forest service road 370 across from Dutchman Flats. Drive 4 miles up this road until you see signs for Forest Service Road 380.  Take a left onto that (this road is terrible).  As you can see from the gps track we decided to head off from a parking lot just off 370 instead of trying to tackle that road. </p>
