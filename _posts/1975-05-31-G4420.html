sub_title: 'This guide will take you on a great hiking trail, a bat loop trail, and even a horse trail along the Clackamas River '
overview: <p>This park has a series of trails that run throughout it but for this guide I wanted to give a taste of three very different ones.  The first is a bat loop trail that will bring you past several bat houses to a barn full of a rare species of bat in Oregon.  The next will take you on a beautiful hiking trail along a ridge of land above the Clackamas River.  The last is a horseback riding trail option if you horses available to you.  </p><p>While you are in the southern section take the time to check out the fish hatchery, the dam and also take a stroll down to the river there as well.   </p>
tips: <p>The park is located just north of the town of Estacada.  Follow Rte 211 out of Estacada and turn right shortly after crossing over the Clackamas River onto S. Hayden Road.  This will take you to S. Springwater road which you'll take a right on and follow until you see the park entrance road on your right.  Use the gps track and guide directions to get you there.  You can either start at the north parking lot or the bat trail parking lot.  </p><p>There is a $5 daily parking fee for the park.  For camping rates please see the attached links. </p>
