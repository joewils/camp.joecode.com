title: Crater Lake - Pinnacles
seo_title: crater-lake-pinnacles
sub_title: 'This trail makes for an easy walk along the rim of Pinnacle Valley. There are great views of volcanic spires. '
overview: <p>When the very hot ash and pumice came to rest near the volcano, it formed 200-to-300-foot (60 to 90 m) thick gas-charged deposits. For perhaps years afterward, hot gas moved to the surface and slowly cemented ash and pumice together in channels and escaped through fumaroles. Erosion later removed most of the surrounding loose ash and pumice, leaving tall pinnacles and spires. </p>
tips: <p>The trailhead lies at the end of the Pinnacles Spur Road, 7 miles Southeast of the Phantom Ship Overlook off of the main Rim Drive, on the southeast corner of the park. </p>
