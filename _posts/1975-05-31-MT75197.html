description: <p>Little Bear Cabin was built in 1938 and still looks much the same as it did back then. It is available year-round for recreationists, as well as for those who seek a quiet mountain retreat.</p><p>The cabin can be accessed by vehicle during warmer months, but winter access requires snowmobiling or skiing 10 miles from the paved road. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.</p>
drivingDirection: <p>From Bozeman, travel south on Highway 191 to Little Bear Road 980. Turn left and continue on the paved and gravel road for 8 miles, to the junction with Forest Service Road 3138. Turn right on Forest Service Road 3138/Wilson Creek Divide Road and proceed approximately 4 miles, to the signed and gated cabin access road, Bear Cabin Road 6988, on the right. The lock on the gate is the same combination as the one to the cabin. The cabin is approximately 300 yards north of the sign.  During the winter, guests will need to park off the road at the point where plowing has stopped, leaving plenty of room for the plow to turn around. It could be up to 10 miles from the cabin, requiring a ski or snowmobile trip.</p>
facilitiesDescription: <p>The cabin has a bunk bed downstairs and two beds in the loft, each with mattresses, to sleep up to four people. There is a wood cook stove which provides some heat, but it may not be sufficient in extremely cold temperatures. A table with chairs, broom, dustpan and snow shovel are provided.   A campfire ring and outhouse with vault toilet are located outside the cabin.</p><p> Water and electricity are not available. Guests must bring their own drinking water, as well as fire starters (matches and newspaper), bedding, dish soap, flashlights or lanterns and extra toilet paper, among other necessities. The cabin must be cleaned and all trash removed prior to leaving.</p>
