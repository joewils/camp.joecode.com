sub_title: Hiking at Saddle Mountain
overview: '<p>Highest point in northwest Oregon, this saddle-shaped peak commands a panorama from the ocean to Mount St. Helens. The climb is especially popular in May and June, when wildflowers fill the mountain''s meadows with teh richest floral display in the Coast Range.The path starts in a forest of alder and salmonberry. Flowers line the trail in spring: candyflower, bleeding hearts, fringecup, trilliums, wild lily-of-the-valley and fairy bells. Old 8-foot stumps recall 1920s logging and 1930s fires. </p>'
