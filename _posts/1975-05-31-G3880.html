sub_title: Spectacular 240-foot suspension bridge that hovers 100 feet above Drift Creek Falls.
overview: <p>Flanked by ferns, alder trees and vine maple, Drift Creek Trail winds through the rain-drenched Siuslaw National Forest.</p><p>The highlight of the trail is a 240-foot long cable suspension bridge. Anchored by cables and ties that are cemented into opposing bluffs, the bridge holds over a hundred fifty thousand pounds.</p><p>While the bridge does offer a bit of a bounce, the thirty-inch wide tread is perfectly safe and the bird&rsquo;s-eye view will leave you spellbound. As does Drift Creek Falls, a 65-foot freefall, whopper of a waterfall that&rsquo;s located immediately below you.</p><p>Grant's Getaways - Drift Creek Trail from Travel Oregon on Vimeo. </p>
tips: <p>From Highway 101 just south of Lincoln City turn east on Drift Creek Rd.  After 1.6 miles at a T turn right on Drift Creek Road. In .4 miles keep slight left on Drift Camp Creek Road.  Follow this road for 10.5 windy miles on a paved road.</p><p>You need a Northwest Forest Pass, which can be bought for $5 at the trailhead. </p>
