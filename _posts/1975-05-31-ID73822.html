orientationDescription: <p>Lochsa is a Nez Perce word meaning &amp;quot;rough water.&amp;quot; The 70-mile river and its tributaries have no dams and the flow is unregulated from its headwaters near the Powell Ranger Station in the Bitterroots, to Lowell, where it joins the Selway River to form the Middle Fork of the Clearwater River. The Lochsa is one of the world&amp;#39;s best for continuous whitewater.</p><p>The campground is situated in a dense forest in north-central Idaho at an elevation of 3,400 feet. It is across the river from the border of the 1.5-million acre Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness. Famed explorers Lewis and Clark passed through on their way to the Pacific Ocean in September of 1805.</p><p>Elk, deer, moose, bear, cougar and mountain goats make the steep canyon country their home.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The Lochsa River provides visitors with opportunities for fishing and other water-related recreation.

A permit is not necessary to float the river, but technical expertise is a must.</p><p>A variety of hiking and horseback riding trails are available in the wilderness area. The 1.5-mile Powell Complex Trail begins near the campground and leads west through cool, shady cedar and larch trees, making for a relaxing day trip.
