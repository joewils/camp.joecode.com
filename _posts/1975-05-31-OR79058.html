note: ''
orientationDescription: <p>Visitors to Umpqua National Forest are often taken aback by the unique landscapes of southwestern Oregon. Explosive geologic events have shaped the distinctive landscape on the nearly 1 million-acre forest, and provide spectacular scenery as well as an abundance of natural and cultural resources.</p><p> The translation of the word, &amp;quot;umpqua,&amp;quot; meaning &amp;quot;thundering waters,&amp;quot; defines the area. High mountain lakes, heart-stopping rapids, peaceful ponds and thundering waterfalls, including the 272-foot Watson Falls on the North Umpqua Highway, provide plenty of pastimes for visitors.</p><p> Diverse ecosystems support a wide range of habitat for wildlife common to the area. From eagles and owls, to salamanders and salmon, these species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests to live.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>In addition to being a prime location for hiking and biking in summer and early fall. The large grassy field is perfect for group activities or sports, and a playground and horseshoe pit are also provided on-site.</p><p>Hikers will enjoy a moderately challenging hike on Swordfern Trail, leaving from the historic Civilian Conservation Corps Campground Register booth, located in the Rujada Picnic Area. The trail parallels the south side of Layng Creek, traveling through a stand of second growth Douglas fir and lush swordfern understory, then climbs to an abandoned logging road. Eventually it loops back to the Rujada Picnic area, or continues on the logging road and back into the camping loop.</p><p>In autumn, visitors will be treated to the brilliant fall colors of the hardwood trees along Layng Creek.</p>
