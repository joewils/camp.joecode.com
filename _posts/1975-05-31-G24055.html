sub_title: 'A strenuous hike that takes you up to the peak of Mount Spokane via the steepest ski run, &quot;No Alibi&quot; - great views. '
overview: '<p>This hike is short in distance, but its second mile will wear you out!  Going off-trail up the No Alibi Ski Run, with undergrowth, uneven ground and rock is challenging.  The views and being off-trail makes an experience unlike any other on Mt. Spokane.  You really feel like you are one with the mountain.  Plus, as you approach the peak, having tourists who drove to the top look down to see you hiking upwards is well worth it.  </p><p>&bull; It is highly recommended to hike up the No Alibi Ski Run, it is at an incline where it is dangerous to attempt to hike it downward.  Going down the Mt. Spokane ski runs is better suited on the runs east of the Vista House. </p><p>&bull; Proper footwear, hiking boots with ankle support is HIGHLY recommended.  Wear liner socks.  Trekking poles to insure your footing and for extra power in getting up the mountain is also recommended.  If you have sensitive skin, wear long pants - the undergrowth can be punishing.</p><p>&bull; FYI: Bring extra water.  The ski run area sees upwards of 18 hours of sun per day during the summer.  As such, a wide brimmed hat is suggested.</p><p>&bull; DOGS: Make sure your dog is in shape to make this climb.  Not only do they have to deal with the steep incline, but they have to jump over and through undergrowth.  My dog hikes 150 miles a month, but the No Alibi Ski Run had him panting like I''ve never seen him do before. </p>'
tips: <p>&bull; If you are viewing this on the phone App - go online for web links to park resources, trail video, and 360&ordm; panorama interactive photos - www.everytrail.com (search Mt. Spokane)</p><p>&bull; Mt. Spokane State Park requires a Washington State Parks Discover Pass ($30 annual or $10 single day use). WA State Parks no longer receive any of your tax dollars. Their operations are financed by user fees.  There is a $99 fine for not having a Discover Pass.  A pass is even required just to drive your car or motorcycle to the top of the mountain. </p><p>&bull; Mt. Spokane, as all state and national parks, is dog leashed only - there is a $75 fine for having your dog off leash. Respect others and stay safe. There is wildlife on Mt. Spokane, you do not need your dog making a moose mad. You probably don't want to know the fine and potential jail time penalties for you dog chasing wildlife. </p><p>&bull; There is wildlife on Mt. Spokane, although, statistically you are not likely to encounter any. Still, know what to do. </p><p>&bull; As always, pack out what you bring in. Don't leave trash, nor discard things like apple cores. They are not natural to the mountain - especially at the higher elevation, please take them back out with you. </p>
