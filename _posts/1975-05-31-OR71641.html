orientationDescription: <p>The campground is surrounded by a sparse forest of alder trees that provide limited shade to the area. It is situated at an elevation of about 2,000 feet in the Mt. Hood National Forest. The 22-acre lake and surrounding wilderness are sheltered from the wind in a narrow, heavily forested canyon of Oregon&amp;#39;s Cascade Mountain Range.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Boating, canoeing and fishing on Lake Harriet are popular activities. The lake is stocked with rainbow trout each year, resulting in easy fly fishing. Anglers can also expect to catch cutthroat and brown trout, which spawn in the nearby river. Campers also enjoy swimming in the clear waters. The campground offers a boat ramp and fishing dock for easy lake access.</p><p>The nearby Oak Grove Fork of Clackamas River is also popular for fishing. Steelhead, chinook and kokanee salmon can often be caught there. Further down the river, the Clackamas provides class III-IV whitewater rafting. The river provides a perfect habitat for the federally threatened bald eagle and northern spotted owl, as well as an occasional peregrine falcon.</p><p>Visitors can also enjoy hiking in the Bull of the Woods Wilderness area, just south of the campground. Several primitive forest roads nearby are useful for mountain biking and the Cascades Scenic Byway, which follows the Clackamas River, runs near the campground.</p>
