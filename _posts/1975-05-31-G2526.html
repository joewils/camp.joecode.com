sub_title: The highpoint of Montana over an amazing 2 day climb.
overview: <p>This 12,799 located in the Beartooth Mountain Range of Montana in the Rockies is one of the harder state highpoints to get due to the distance technical challenge of the last 200 feet of the summit block.  When you get up there it will look impossible but if you can make it across the snow bridge safely there is a route you can scramble up to the summit.  Some will want to bring a rope though with some protection so they can rappel down from the top.  This is a wonderful two day climb through beautiful alpine lakes with lots of mountain goats to see along the way. </p>
