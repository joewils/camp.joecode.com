  <p>Petrified Tree: Subtropical Yellowstone
  This petrified redwood is a clue to a watmer, damper, more liolent Yellowstone landscape. Anatomically the trunk is indistinguishable from present-day redwoods in California.</p><p>When a chain of volcanoes erupted here in Eocene times 50 million years ago, they triggered massive landslides into mountain and valley streams. The rolling mix of ash, water and sand buried whole forests. Before the trees could rot, abundant silica in the volcanic flow plugged living cells, creating &quot;forests of stone.&quot;</p><p>Volcanic ash and mudflows obliterated a living landscape yet preserved this t ree for the ages. There wer three redwoods standing here before thoughtless souvenir-hunters chipped away the other two. The 1907 photograph shows a second trunk in the background (before this trunk was fenced). </p>
tips: <p>Hydrothermal features are fragile rarities of nature. Yellowstone preserves the largest collection of hydrothermal features on the planet. You have an unparalleled opportunity to view hot springs, geysers, mudpots, and fumaroles in a natural setting.</p><p>Change takes place naturally in a hydrothermal area, but people can disrupt these processes and cause irreparable damage. Rocks, sticks, and other objects thrown into a hydrothermal feature may be permanently cemented in place, choking off water circulation and ending all activity.</p><p>For the sake of all who follow, never throw objects into any feature. Stay on established walkways for your safety and to protect fragile formations that have formed over thousands of years.</p><p>It is illegal to collect any natural or cultural objects or to remove, deface, or destroy any plant, animal, or mineral in Yellowstone's hydrothermal areas. Bring drinking water; take out all trash.</p><p>While viewing or photographing the area, protect your camera, glasses, and binocular lenses from hydrothermal heat and stray.</p><p>Toxic gases exist in Yellowstone. Dangerous levels of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide have been measured in some hydrothermal areas. If you feel sick, leave the location immediately.</p><p>Help preserve Yellowstone for the future. </p>
