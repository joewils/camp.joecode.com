sub_title: Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve
overview: "<p>This loop walk includes the two primary loops and hilltop viewing areas at Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve. Generally an easy-to-moderate jaunt, this walk can get tough in high heat or in strong gusty desert winds. Bring plenty of water and wind protection. And don't forget the sunscreen. </p><p>This park was established to protect outstanding seasonal displays of native wildflowers, in particular the California Poppy, our state flower. The park includes  seven miles of trails winding through wildflower fields, hilltops, and a lovely spring-fed desert valley. </p><p>The wildflower blooms generally happen from March through May with the peak viewing period in Mid-April. The best poppy showing occurs when the temperature is over 70F and wind is less than 10mph.</p><p>In season watch for:\nPoppies, filaree, fiddleneck, silver puff, pygmy-leaved lupine, bush lupine, lacey phacelia, slender keel fruit, forget-me-not, fringe pod, wild onions, red maids, sun cups, gold fields, owl's clover, hairy lotus, cream cups and rattlesnake weed.</p><p>Please Note: rattlesnakes are out! \nThe Mojave green rattlesnakes can be active in the daytime on cool-to-warm days. They come out in the evenings on hot days. Rattlesnakes are not aggressive and will not attack unless startled or threatened. When you approach they almost always make you aware of their presence, as they want to avoid a confrontation. </p><p>If you encounter one on a trail, it will most likely move out of your way if you just hang back and give it space. </p><p>Keep in mind, rattlesnakes are an important part of the food web and without them, rodents could rapidly overpopulate and consume the flowers that the park is famous for. They are now a protected animal.</p><p>The Mojave Desert Interpretive Association, an active local non-profit, helps support this cause as well as nearby state parks.
