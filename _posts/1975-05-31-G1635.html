sub_title: 'Short nature trail building to a crescendo at the foot of one of California''s most spectacular waterfalls. '
overview: "<p>Without question Burney Falls is one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the state. The 129ft waterfall thrills visitors to McArthur Burney Falls Memorial State Park all year round, even when the California summer has dried up every other waterfall around.</p><p>Located in the Cascade mountains, forty miles north of Lassen Volcanic National Park the falls are given their longevity by the release of meltwater from porus volcanic rock from the surrounding mountains. </p><p>Two large streams cascade from the top of the falls and are accompanied by curtains of water fed from underground streams, creating a unique and grand appearance to the waterfall.</p><p>Our one mile journey loops around the falls in a clockwise direction, beginning with an overlook from above the waterfall and descending into the valley towards the foot of the attraction. With the falls hidden from view for much of the trail, we can focus on the interpretive signs on the nature trail and enjoy the shade that the park's greenery provides.</p><p>The crescendo of the trail reaches its peak at the bottom of Burney Falls where you can experience the force nature from up close. The return journey is along a short set of switchbacks which afford even more views of the falls.</p><p>Elevation gain: \n&bull; Approx 250ft (from 2,750 - 2,900ft) </p>"
