Just 45 minutes from Bend, this emerald beauty sits on the backside of Mt. Bachelor with the Three Sisters Wilderness in the distance.</p><p>The area provides habitat for mammals such as mule deer, coyote, and cougar. Migratory birds and native fish also call the area home. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests to live.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>A favorite among horse enthusiasts, the campground provides visitors access to a variety of trails. Lakes, lava flows, and forested area provide the backdrop for many of these rides.</p><p>Quinn Creek Trail is short and sweet and begins in the campground. It follows Quinn Creek past the north end of Hosmer Lake and on to the Metolius-Windigo Horse Trail. With only a short shuttle by bike or car between Sparks and Devils Lake, a longer, 11-mile loop can be made by connecting the Katsuk Pond Trail from Devils Lake Trailhead to Quinn Creek, and then on to Sparks Lake via the Metolius-Windigo Horse Trail.</p><p>The Metolius-Windigo Trail is a long-distance trail open to horseback riders, hikers and mountain bikers. It can be accessed from several trailheads. At over 100 miles in length, this trail begins near the Metolius River headwaters west of Sisters and runs south to Windigo Pass near Crescent Lake.</p><p>The trail was created in the 1980s, primarily to serve long-distance horseback riders seeking an alternative to the Pacific Crest Trail. Because of its lower elevation, this trail is snow-free longer than trails at higher elevations. It passes through a wide variety of scenic terrain and forest types.</p>
