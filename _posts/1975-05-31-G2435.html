sub_title: Four waterfalls along the Little River in the North Umpqua River Valley.
overview: <p>These waterfalls are all along the Little River area in the  North Umpqua River Valley. Three of the waterfall trails start from Little River Road, with only Grotto Falls taking you off the main drag and onto a gravel road.</p><p>Yakso &amp; Hemlock Falls can be accessed from the same parking area/campground.</p><p>Make sure you have plenty of time as it can take most of the day to drive between and hike to the four waterfalls.</p><p>All of Oregon's waterfalls can be appreciated the most during the wet season due to the increased water flow in the streams and rivers. But access to some of these waterfalls (especially Grotto Falls) can become difficult in December-March because of snow.</p><p>We found downed trees and lots of snow in mid December on the way to Grotto Falls. </p>
tips: <p>To get here take Interstate I-5 to Roseburg exit 124 and follow Hwy 138 east to milepost 16, turn south on Little River Road (County Road 17) </p><p> </p>
