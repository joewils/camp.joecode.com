orientationDescription: <p>Eagleview is situated along the Umpqua River in southwestern Oregon. It is only one of two rivers in Oregon with headwaters that begin high up in the Cascade Mountains and meander on down to the Pacific Ocean. The campground lies in a broad river canyon surrounded by deeply forested mountainsides.</p><p>The name, Umpqua, is a surviving term of the Native American Umpqua language, and translates to &amp;quot;thundering waters,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;satisfied,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;across the waters.&amp;quot;</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Fishing enthusiasts will enjoy the chance to catch chinook salmon, coho, steelhead or smallmouth bass depending on the season. Float the river on a kayak or canoe or just swim in the cool Umpqua waters on a hot summer&amp;#39;s day. These are just a few of the many things to do at Eagleview.</p>
