description: <p>The Hamma Hamma Cabin is a historic cabin that offers guests a tranquil setting to relax and recreate. Formerly a guard station, the cabin was built from 1936-1937 by the Civilian Conservation Corps. The facility was used as an administrative site for Forest Service fire and trail crews. The site is nominated to the National Register  of Historic Places for the skill and craftsmanship that went into its construction and architecture.</p><p>The cabin is open year-round and is typically accessible by car; however, snowy conditions require alternative transportation such as cross-country skis or snowshoes. Many amenities are offered, so guests only need to bring a few of their own supplies for an enjoyable stay.</p>

orientationDescription: <p>Hamma Hamma Cabin sits on a landscaped clearing surrounded by old-growth Douglas firs, dogwoods and rhododendrons. The scenic Hamma Hamma River flows nearby, which is fed by the Mildred Lakes within the Mt. Skokomish Wilderness and drops from the eastern slope of the Olympic Range into the Hood Canal. The  name Hamma Hamma comes from a Twana village once located at the river&amp;#39;s mouth and called Hab&amp;#39;hab, referring to a reed that grows along the river&amp;#39;s banks.</p><p>Mt. Skokomish Wilderness, located in the southeast corner of Olympic National Forest, is accessible from the area. Bold rocky summits and numerous sharp spires dot  the ridges at elevations ranging from 2,000 to over 6,000 feet.</p><p>Magnificent old-growth western hemlock, western red cedar and Douglas fir dominate the forest in the lower elevations, providing habitat for elk, black-tailed deer,  black bears and mountain lions. Higher elevations display firs, pines, dwarf juniper and open rock faces that are home to marmots and mountain goats.</p>
