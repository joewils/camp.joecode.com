description: <p>Graham Cabin, a former Forest Service Guard Station, is an ideal getaway for motorcyclists, flight enthusiasts and equestrians, for whom getting there is half the  fun. An airstrip is just across from the cabin for guests who want to fly in, and the surrounding terrain is ideal for traversing on foot, horseback or motorcycle.</p><p>Guests to the cabin will find a few amenities but may need to bring some additional supplies and gear to make their stay comfortable. The beauty of the surrounding  landscape and the abundance of recreational activities make for a relaxing and enjoyable experience.</p>
drivingDirection: '<p>Graham Cabin is 53 miles northeast of Idaho City. From Idaho City, take Highway 21 for 18 miles to Crooked River-Little Owl Road #384.

There are only 2 major road intersections on Road #312; just keep bearing right andfollow the directional signs.   Vehicle access to the area is generally limited from mid-July to the beginning of October due to high elevation snow.

Plan on a minimum 3-hour trip from Idaho City to the cabin.  Guests arriving on horseback can either ride horses the last 10 miles of Road #312 or ride the 6-mile Horse Heaven Trail from Road # 327 (just beyond Deer Park).</p>'

orientationDescription: <p>Graham Cabin is located on the North Fork Boise River, adjacent to the Sawtooth Wilderness at an elevation of 5,720 feet. The dwelling sits in an open grassy area  surrounded by the rugged mountain peaks of the Sawtooth Range, which are dotted with evergreens. The surrounding area still exhibits some signs of a past forest fire.</p><p>Wildlife watchers may spot elk, deer, mountain goats, wolves, coyotes, cougars, bobcats and bears. The occasional wolverine may also be seen, as their numbers are  growing within the Sawtooth Wilderness.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Several trails located within 2 miles of the cabin offer superb horseback riding opportunities, including the nearby Horse Heaven Trail. These trails are in varying stages of maintenance, but tend to be in good condition for at least 2 miles. Hikers can follow the river all the way to its headwaters in the Sawtooth Wilderness. Motorcyclists can ride the nearby roads.</p><p>Fishing is good in the river and nearby Johnson Creek. Big game hunting is a popular activity in season.</p>
