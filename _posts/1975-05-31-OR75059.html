description: <p>Antlers Guard Station was built in 1935 for the fire crews who patrolled Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. The Forest Roads were not yet well developed, and it was impractical for crews to travel daily between the remote parts of the forest and the ranger station. The Civilian Conservation Corps built this structure to allow crews to stay where they worked. Antlers Guard Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.</p><p>Guests who stay at Antlers Guard Station can still get away from it all while enjoying the basic comforts of home. The cabin is accessible by car. The road leading to the cabin is typically plowed in winter, but snow chains, shovels or high clearance vehicles may be required to get through the deep snow in the driveway.</p>
