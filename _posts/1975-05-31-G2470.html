overview: <p>You'll want to spend an afternoon at this wonderful park.  From the viewing area you'll see many seabirds including cormorants, murres, and maybe even puffins.  There is a lighthouse you can enter and climb up, a giant 50' diameter &quot;Octopus Tree&quot;, a crazy tall Spruce Tree and a beautiful shoreline to explore.  If you follow the track in this guide you'll be able to literally explore every trail in the park.   </p>
tips: "<p>Permits are not required. \nDirections:\nDrive 10 miles west on Three Capes Scenic Highway from Tillamook off US 101.   You'll see signs for the park.  Park the car at the end of the entrance road and get ready to explore all the trails and sights! </p>"
