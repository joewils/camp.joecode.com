sub_title: 'This is a challenging 13.3 mile hike, with 2,600 foot elevation gain/drop.  '
overview: <p>This guide is rated difficult simply because of its elevation variation and total distance.  I call it the Diego Challenge.  After my 12 lbs miniature Schnauzer who hiked it, and when finished, still wanted to keep going.  It is a fun hike, takes you through several fauna zones of the mountain.  All different type of trail surfaces, and overall tests your hiking abilities.  Day Mountain peak is also one of the nicest places in Mt. Spokane State Park, a great place to stop for lunch.</p><p>&bull; Mt. Spokane is a fee area, a Washington State Parks Discover Pass is required - $30 annual or $10 for single day use.  The State Parks no longer receive any of your tax dollars, their operations are financed by fees.  This includes just driving into the parks, for example to drive to the top of Mt. Spokane.  There is a $99 fine for not having a Discover Pass. </p>
tips: '<p>If using the phone App: Go online for web links to maps &amp; resources, trail video, and 360&ordm; panorama interactive photos. www.everytrail.com</p><p>&bull; Make sure you are in shape for this and wear proper equipment.  Shoes or hiking boots that will not give you blisters.  Liner socks - I like the one''s that look like gloves.  A trekking pole (or a set) does assist on the uphills - and is also good on tired legs coming back down.  Especially the last 3 miles, all downhill, with the last 1/2 mile having a really steep drop. </p><p>&bull; Warning: you will consume more water than what you expect, bring extra!!! </p><p>&bull; FYI - As all trails on Mt. Spokane, this is leashed dogs only.  There is a $75 fine.  I have run across moose, sure glad the dog was leashed.  Don''t need him pissing off a moose.  You probably don''t want to know the fine and potential jail time penalties for you dog chasing wildlife. </p>'
