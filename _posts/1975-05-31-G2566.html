sub_title: The rocky summit of this 4,049' mountain is reachable from the southeast
overview: <p>The alpine zone of this 4,049' mountain is only second in size to Katahdin in Maine.  It has a large boulder-strewn summit ridge with an old fire tower on the summit.  You'll pass a historic fire warden cabin on the trail up.  This mountain is pretty remote and you won't be able to get too close to it until the roads below are well plowed out in the spring. </p>
tips: |-
  <p>Fire Warden's Trailhead:
  After passing through Kingfield on ME-27, turn left onto West Kingfield Street.  The pavement ends in about 3 miles.  6 miles from ME-27 turn left and cross two bridges over Rapid Stream.  After crossing the stream look for the trailhead about 0.5 miles down the road on the right. </p>
