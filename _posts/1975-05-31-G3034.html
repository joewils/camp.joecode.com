sub_title: A short hike to this beautiful 97 foot waterfall along Tumalo Creek just outside of Bend, Oregon
overview: <p>This is a short 2 mile hike to two beautiful waterfalls on Tumalo Creek beneath Broken Top Mountain.  The first one you encounter is the largest at 97 feet while the 2nd (Double Falls) drops 30 and then 20 feet with about a mile in between.  You can hike further up Tumalo Creek for more smaller waterfalls if you have time.  If you get here late, don't worry as the first viewpoint is directly next to the trailhead. </p>
