tips: |-
  <p>- Even though the trail is surrounded by rivers, streams, and lakes, bring plenty of your own water. It is not advisable to drink the water from nearby waterways.
  - Cell phone service is spotty in some areas, so don't rely on a mobile phone as your only communication method.
  - Although pets are allowed on the trail, they should be kept on a fairly short leash and under constant supervision. Always pick up after your pet and deposit their &quot;trail donations&quot; in the proper receptacles. </p>
