orientationDescription: <p>Hemmed in by several designated wilderness areas, the Mt.

Baker Wilderness Area. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, this active volcano is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.</p><p>From the high snowfields and glaciers of Mt. Baker, Mt.Shuksan and the Twin Sisters range in the North Cascades, the Nooksack River system provides habitat for many species to survive. Wildlife in the area includes a variety of salmon species, elk, bald eagle and cougar. Migratory birds and an occasional black bear find ample habitat in the varied ecosystems as well.</p>

Baker Scenic Byway, highlighting old-growth forests, gushing whitewater rapids and forest wildflowers.
