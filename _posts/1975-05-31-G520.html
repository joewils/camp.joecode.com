sub_title: Whether you measure your lakes by quality or quantity, this hike's a winner either way.
overview: "<p>Located four hours north east of San Francisco this Northern California park might be a little out of the way, but it&rsquo;s a prime destination for seekers of tranquility and those with even just a passing interest in geology.</p><p>This guide explores a chain pristine lakes and pools at least a dozen in number, on this loop trail deep in the heart of Lassen Volcanic National Park. </p><p>Elevation gain: \n&bull; 1,100ft (from 6,600 - 7,200ft)</p><p>Tips:\n&bull; Summer through fall is the best time to experience this trail. Snow covers the Lassen landscape for much of the year, closing roads and obscuring trails. See our links below to National Park Service information on road and trail closures.\n&bull; Bug repellent is a necessity early in the summer season when mosquitoes are rife.</p><p>Alternatives:\n&bull; Consider a shorter 7-8 mile out-and-back route to the Twin lakes.\n </p>"
