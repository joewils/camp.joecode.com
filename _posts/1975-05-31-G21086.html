sub_title: 'Easy hiking that''s suitable for everyone.  Trails are groomed cross country ski trails.  '
overview: '<p>The hike out to Quartz Mountain is fun, you can vary the length and difficulty of your hike by which trails you choose.  Its great for any hiking fitness level.  From picnickers and novice hikers, to seasoned hikers breaking in equipment or wanting an area mostly used by foot traffic.  </p><p>&bull; Its also a great place to take the family, especially to find a cooler place to head in the summer time.  Hike in for a picnic.  Kids will love to run around these trails.  </p><p>&bull; The views from the top of Quartz Mountain are as spectacular as from the top of Mt. Spokane, with the added satisfaction that you made it up there under your own power.</p><p>&bull; Mt. Spokane is a fee area, a Washington State Parks Discover Pass is required - $30 annual or $10 for single day use.  The State Parks no longer receive any of your tax dollars, their operations are financed by fees.  Don''t be a cheapskate, get a Discover Pass.  This includes just driving into the parks, for example to drive to the top of Mt. Spokane.  There is a $99 fine for not having a Discover Pass.</p><p>&bull; For GPS navigation to the trail head, the coordinates are: 47.90323, -117.10005 </p>'
tips: '<p>If using the phone App: Go online for web links to maps &amp; resources, trail video, and 360&ordm; panorama interactive photos. www.everytrail.com</p><p>&bull; As always, pack out what you take in.  Keep noise down so not to disturb wildlife.  Keep an eye out for wildlife, I came across a moose, but I was there on a quiet day early in the hiking season.  </p><p>&bull; Wear proper footwear, tennis shoes will suffice for this hike.  Bring bug spray for the top of Quartz Mountain.  </p><p>&bull; Respect the privacy of the people who have rented the Fire Lookout.  Most likely it will be rented the day you are up there.  Do not climb up on the Fire Lookout itself, as it has been rented.  </p><p>&bull; FYI - Dogs are restricted to be leashed at the Mount Spokane State Park, you can get a $75 fine for not having your dog leashed.  There are moose on Mt. Spokane, you don''t need the dog pissing off a moose!  You probably don''t want to know the fine and potential jail time penalties for you dog chasing wildlife. </p>'
