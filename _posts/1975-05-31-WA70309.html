note: ''
orientationDescription: <p>Hemmed in by several designated wilderness areas, the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest showcases rugged peaks, sparkling   alpine lakes and old-growth forests.</p><p>Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area, dominates the landscape on a clear day. Rising to an   elevation of 10,781 feet, the active volcano from which the forest takes its name is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an   extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a   massive volcanic crater.</p><p>Wildlife in the area include mountain goats, coyotes, pine marten and a variety of migratory birds and native fish.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>In addition to being a prime location for hiking, boating and fishing in summer and early fall, Park Creek offers excellent  skiing and snowshoeing in the winter months.</p><p>Over 1,500 miles of trails in the area can entice any hiker to get outdoors. From smooth paths meandering through deep quiet   forests to challenging ascents up boulder-studded mountains, opportunities abound for every skill level.</p><p>Shadow of the Sentinels Trail, a barrier-free interpretive trail winding through dense forest   growth, sits nearby. Huge Douglas fir and cedar trees tower above a forest floor of ferns, moss and berry bushes, and interpretive signs along   the route explain the dynamics of this 500-year-old ancient forest. The trail is constructed of asphalt and boardwalks with grades   no greater than 8 percent.</p>
