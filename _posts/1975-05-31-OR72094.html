orientationDescription: <p>Visitors can catch a glimpse of the area&amp;#39;s unique geological features by exploring nearby Paulina Lake, located within the collapsed crater, or &amp;quot;caldera&amp;quot; of Newberry Volcano.</p><p>The lake covers a surface area of 1,531 acres and reaches depths of up to 250 ft., but neither Paulina Lake or its twin, East Lake, receives water from an inlet stream. Instead, each lake relies on relies on rain, snowmelt and hot springs for water.</p><p>Paulina Creek drains the lake and has chiseled a narrow gorge through the caldera&amp;#39;s west wall creating a remarkable twin waterfall. Thermal vents and hot springs along the lake&amp;#39;s northeast edge help create a highly productive ecosystem.</p><p>Wetlands, diverse forests, and rocky slopes near the campground provide a necessary habitat for shorebirds, racoons, deer, bats, and the occasional black bear.   In September, the outlet of Paulina Lake may be choked with Kokanee salmon moving to spawn in Paulina Creek.</p>
