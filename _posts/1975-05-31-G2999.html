sub_title: A nice 6 mile cross-country ski to Paulina Falls in the winter.
overview: <p>In the winter time the Peter Ogden trailhead is the furthest the road to Paulina Lake is plowed (mostly for snowmobile use).  From this trailhead you'll head through the woods for almost 3 miles to the 60 foot beautiful waterfall.  I've included some photos of my friends and I ice climbing the falls but this should only be attempted if you have experience as it can be very dangerous.  If you have time continue on up the trail just a little further to check out the outlet of Paulina Lake. </p>
tips: |-
  <p>Directions:
  22 miles south of Bend on U.S. 97 take a left onto Service Road 21 following signs towards Paulina Lake.  Follow this road until you see signs for the Peter Ogden trailhead or you come to a closed gate and unplowed road beyond (which should be the same place). </p>
