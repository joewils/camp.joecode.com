overview: <p>The Chirico Trail is a lovely spot located just off of I-90 in Issaquah. It is conveniently located and after about 700 feet of elevation the noise from any roads disappears. It is easy to reach and leaves the user in the forest and forgetting how close I-90 and Highway 18 are for most of the trail. The south launch area allows the users to have lovely valley views while looking out over the top of the nudist colony. The north launch area of Poo-Poo Point allows the user to have lovely views of the Lake Sammamish and Issaquah.  </p>
tips: <p>Standard day-hiking gear is utilized and what is required will depend upon the day. In winter, the trail can be wet from rain or slippery with ice, depending on the weather. In summer, the trail is used more frequently and ofter users are found hiking up wearing shorts and t-shirts. Again, watch out of the pilots about to land as one enters the landing zone (LZ) at beginning and conclusion of the trail. </p>
