importantInformation: <p> In accordance with standard industry practices, Mount Hood Recreation will be assessing a $8 additional vehicle fee on the &apos;second vehicle&apos; in each single family campsite, and on the &apos;third and fourth vehicle&apos; in any double family campsite, provided these vehicles are not joined to the first vehicle by a hitch and towed onto the site. In the case of motorcycles, the first two are considered as one vehicle for determining additional vehicle fees. The third and fourth motorcycle would also be considered as one vehicle. No additional vehicle fees are collected for bicycles. Off-road vehicle use is prohibited within the campground Click here for more information on Mt. Hood National Forest The campground is managed by Mount Hood Recreation, a division of Northwest Land Management. Comment forms and more information are available from campground hosts or on our website . Due to the spread of invasive insects, firewood from outside the area is not permitted. Help protect our forests by purchasing or collecting firewood at or near your camping destination and burning it on-site. Click here for more information.</p>

The Upper Clackamas Whitewater Festival is hosted annually in May, attracting rafters from all over the country.</p>
note: ''
orientationDescription: <p>The campground is situated along the river at an elevation of about 900 feet in Mt. Hood National Forest. Most campsites are within a dense stand of cedar trees overlooking the river. Sites are fairly close together and there is very little vegetation on the forest floor.</p><p>The forest provides habitat for the federally protected bald eagle and northern spotted owl, as well as an occasional peregrine falcon. A variety of wildlife makes its home in the area.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Fishing is very popular in the Clackamas River and anglers can expect a catch of winter steelhead, spring Chinook and late summer Coho salmon, as well as other species of freshwater fish. The Clackamas contains miles of wild water as it bends and drops through the scenic Cascade Range, creating prime whitewater rafting opportunities.</p><p>A hiking trail follows the river north and south and begins about a mile away at Fish Creek Campground.  Scenic driving is also available on the West Cascades Scenic Byway, which travels alongside the river.</p>
