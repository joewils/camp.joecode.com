seo_title: blue-lake-trail-to-dock-butte
sub_title: 'Great Trail for a short day hike with excellent scenery...in late summer the huckleberries are thick. '
overview: <p>This is a trail that off shoots from the common shared Blue Lake Trail. </p><p>The trail head parking lot has a quality outhouse facility. As with many upper elevation trails, late summer is a premium season for the hike due to the beautiful colors. Excellent view of Mt Baker in a few spots. The trail is very nice, not dangerous, but you will need to be in descent health or stop often for a breather many time :-)</p><p>The drive to the parking lot is descent. </p>
tips: <p>You can find this location if you take Hwy 20 and make the turn toward Baker Lake. As usual, a map is recommended. </p>
