seo_title: bohemia-mountain-amp-ghost-town
sub_title: A short hike with a beautiful view.  Also explore an old mining town, including gold mines.
overview: <p>The Bohemia Mountain Trail leads up a steep grade to the rocky summit of Bohemia Mountain, the highest point on the Cottage Grove District. On a clear day, view the peaks of the Cascade Range from Mt. Hood to Mt. Shasta. Wildflowers bloom along rock meadows and bluffs in late June. </p><p>Below the mountain is the ghost town of Bohemia City.  You'll find a few old remnants of the town including several mines that have been collapsed, and which you SHOULD NOT ENTER.  I've marked one old mine on the guide which is ok to take a look inside.</p><p>You'll also find huge piles of tailings with lots of cool mineral deposits including quartz, pyrite and small bits of gold. </p>
tips: '<p>The trailhead is 40 miles southeast of Cottage Grove. From Interstate 5, take the Cottage Grove Exit #174, turning left on Row River Road, #2400, and follow signs toward Dorena Lake. Continue on Row River Road for 20 miles to the end where it junctions with Brice Creek and Layng Creek Road. Stay to your right following Brice Creek County Road #2470 for 12 miles.  Staying on Brice Creek Road, just past milepost 12, turn right onto graveled Noonday Road, #2212 following the signs to Fairview Peak and travel for 6.7 miles to the ridgeline junction of Roads #2212 and 2212-767. Stay to your right on #2212 for another 2.1 miles to Champion Saddle. From here stay to your left, entering #2460, and continue 1.1 miles to Bohemia Saddle where the road junctions with Fairview Peak Road. The trail is located at Bohemia Saddle.</p><p>Bring good hiking shoes, and it''s a good idea to have hiking poles or a stick, as the trail down to the Ghost Town is steep with loose rock.</p><p>Bring a flashlight to explore the mine/cave located on this map.</p><p>Remember that there is a great deal of private property (patented mining claims) and valid mineral claims being worked.  Miners&rsquo; and property owners&rsquo; rights must be respected. </p>'
