sub_title: 'An overnight backpacking trip through the Boulder Creek Wilderness. The effects of a 1996 fire can be observed. '
overview: <p>This Wilderness area was burned in a 1996 fire that makes this hike all the more interesting as it wanders in and out of affected areas. Burned stands of trees and seemingly untouched forest sit side by side in some cases. </p><p>Those with an interest in volcanic geology will be interested in the volcanic origins of this area. </p>
tips: "<p>This area gets extremely hot and dry in the summer time. Plan for your backcountry water needs appropriately. \nThere are a few patches of poison oak along the trail at some spots.\nCheck with the Ranger station for trail closures. There was fish ladder construction going on in 2010 when this trip was documented that was to continue into 2011 and will affect some of the trails in this area. See the links and resources section for contact information. </p>"
