sub_title: Variety of trails around North Head.  Highlights include old fort, lighthouse, and coastal forest.
overview: <p>This is a nice hike through coastal forest.  The Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition came through here looking for a place to build camp for winter, before they ultimatly crossed back over the Columbia near Astoria.  There are a few signs along the way detailing their journey.</p><p>You also get to see North Head Lighthouse, and if you pay $2.50 you can go inside.</p><p>I really enjoyed exploring the McKenzie Head World War II bunker, where they had stationed guns to guard the mouth of the Columbia River.  Bring a flashlight to explore all the rooms and corridors. </p>
tips: |-
  <p>When I hiked this trail I did it one-way (4 miles) and started at Beard's Hollow.  However, if you don't have a shuttle car and you want to go both directions (8 miles) you will probably want to start at McKenzie Head.  </p><p>If you start at Beard's Hollow, or North Head Lighthouse you will be traveling downhill to McKenzie Head.</p><p>From Seattle:
  Take I-5 south to Olympia, SR 8 west to Montesano. From there, take U.S. Hwy. 101 south to Long Beach Peninsula. Follow signs to Ilwaco and Cape Disappointment park. Then </p><p>From Portland:
  Take I-5 north to Longview, then SR 4 west to U.S. Hwy. 101. Then drive south to Long Beach Peninsula. Follow signs to Ilwaco and Cape Disappointment park. </p>
