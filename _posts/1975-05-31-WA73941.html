description: <p>American Ridge Lodge is located approximately 38 miles west of Naches, Washington in the foothills of the eastern Cascades. The lodge is available for reservation year-round, offering visitors a glimpse into the unique ski history of the area. Larger groups and gatherings will find this spacious facility to be an ideal setting for recreation and relaxation.</p><p>In the 1930s, the Yakima Valley Ski Club worked with the U.S. Forest Service to construct the American River Ski Bowl, one of the first downhill ski areas in Washington State. The rustic ski lodge and unique 20-seater outhouse were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in connection with the ski area, which was operated into the 1950s.</p><p> By the late 1950s, White Pass Ski Area was built, offering deeper snow, a longer ski season and steeper slopes. American Ridge Ski Bowl lay vacant for years, until the lodge and outhouse were carefully restored and made available to the public for reservation.</p>
