description: <p>Deadwood Lookout Recreation Cabin is a historic former Forest Service fire lookout on Deadwood Mountain. The structure provides sweeping panoramic views of the surrounding forest, making this a unique place to overnight.</p><p>At least two other lookouts have existed previously on Deadwood Mountain, but the current one was built in 1934 by the Civilian Conservation Corps.

Guests can drive to the cabin, but high clearance vehicles are recommended for the dirt access road because it is narrow, steep and winding.</p><p>The cabin offers only a few basic amenities.
