description: <p>Liz Creek Cabin was built in 1929 as a single-room cabin with a front porch. This is a good example of a common type of backcountry guard station built for Forest Service workers at that time. It&amp;#39;s now eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.</p><p>Guests must hike or mountain bike to reach the cabin via the Weitas Creek Trail or the Liz Butte Trail. Weitas Creek can accommodate off-road vehicles for the first 7.8 miles; the last 1.5 miles must be completed on foot. Liz Butte requires 3 miles of travel on foot or mountain bike.</p><p>  Only a few amenities are provided, so guests will need to bring most of their own supplies and gear.</p>
