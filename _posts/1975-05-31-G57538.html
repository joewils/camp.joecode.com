sub_title: 11 mile trail near Orick, California
overview: <p>Prairie Creek Loop is about 11.5 miles long and located near Orick, California. The trail is great for hiking and normally takes about 4 -6 hours.</p><p>Beautiful loop from Prairie Creek Visitor Center down to the beach along a ridge, then about a mile along the beach before heading back through Fern Canyon (awesome) and up a couple of small river valleys and a saddle. From the visitor center follow the James Irvine trail for about 3/4 mile until the Miner's Ridge trail and head left on this down to the beach. You can walk along the beach or take the inland dirt road for about a mile north until you hit the trailhead for Fern Canyon/James Irvine trail.&nbsp;For the first 3/10ths of a mile you can take the dry route (James Irvine) or the wet route (recommended) where you walk along the river through a beautiful narrow canyon lined with ferns. This part ends at the intersection with the James Irvine trail back to the visitor center. </p>
