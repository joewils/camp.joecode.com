sub_title: The Yellowstone River overlook is a short interpretive trail overlooking the Yellowstone River.
overview: <p>Yellowstone River Overlook, also called Calcite Springs Overlook Trail, is a short, easy loop walk that leads to a platform overlooking the Yellowstone River. Layers of basalt columns and thermal springs along the river's edge are also visible. The area was named by USGS geologist Arnold Hague in 1885, but the name was based on previous usage. The constriction in the river is called &quot;The Narrows.&quot; Early explorers discovered the sulphur to be &quot;pure enough to burn readily when ignited.&quot; Research conducted during the 1930s found the springs to have the highest percentage of hydrogen sulfide gas as well as deposits of calcite and gypsum. Calcite Springs is the lowest elevation of any hot area in the park.</p><p>The east wall of the Grand Canyon, facing the overlook, is a cross-section of layers of glacial drift resting on lake deposits and columnar basalt. The haxagonal columns of basalt are caused by cooling, shrinking and cracking of several basaltic flows. </p>
tips: <p>Take time to walk the whole loop.</p>
