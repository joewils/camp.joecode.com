High mountain lakes, heart-stopping rapids, peaceful ponds and thundering waterfalls, including the 272-foot Watson Falls on the North Umpqua Highway, are available to visitors.</p><p>   Several designated wilderness areas provide undisturbed solitude. Encompassing 19,100 acres, Boulder Creek Wilderness is an incredible landscape, with dense old growth forests and steep terrain that tower above Boulder Creek.</p><p> The most popular area in Boulder Creek is Pine Bench.
