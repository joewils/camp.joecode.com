description: <p>Located in the northeast portion of Olympic National Forest, Louella Cabin offers guests a unique lodging experience. It was built in 1912 by Forest Service employee,  E. M. Cheney, who dedicated the structure to his wife, Louella. A fireguard was stationed at the cabin during the summer and fall.</p><p>During the Great Depression, a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp was built in the lower part of the meadow below the cabin and consisted of barracks, a bathhouse  and mess hall. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the CCC worked on many projects in the area, including fire lookouts, trails, bridges, roads and planting trees after  forest fires. After the CCC camp closed in 1939, the guard station was used by various agencies until 1976.</p><p>Today, the site offers guests year-round recreation and relaxation in Olympic National Forest. Access to the cabin is by vehicle; however, snow chains may be required in winter. The cabin offers several amenities, but guests will need to bring a few of their own supplies for a truly enjoyable stay.</p>

note: ''
orientationDescription: <p>Louella Cabin sits on a gentle slope overlooking a valley and flanked by a canopy of towering Douglas fir.</p><p>Buckhorn Wilderness is accessible from the cabin. Located in the northeast corner of Olympic National Forest, the wilderness area is divided into northern and southern portions by the Dungeness River. The northern portion descends from higher mountainous terrain to lowlands, heavily forested in fir, hemlock, and cedar with an understory of moss, ferns, and berry bushes. South of the river, the terrain soars skyward to alpine meadows and rocky ridges.</p><p>Magnificent old-growth western hemlock, western red cedar and Douglas fir dominate the forest, providing habitat for elk, black-tailed deer, black bears and mountain lions.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The cabin is conveniently located near the Buckhorn Wilderness, which offers excellent opportunities for backpacking, horseback riding, hunting, mountain climbing and hiking, with over 58 miles of trails.</p><p>Anglers will enjoy fishing the wild and scenic Dungeness River, and are drawn to it for steelhead and cutthroat trout, as well as chinook, coho and a unique pink salmon that is an entirely native wild stock with no hatchery influence. The river is the second steepest river in the United States, with its headwaters high on Mount Mystery in Olympic National Park, and descending into Dungeness Bay on the Strait of Juan de Fuca.</p>
