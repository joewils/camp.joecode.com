sub_title: Short easy hike to Lower Soda Falls.  Nice large campground and wading in the South Santiam River.
overview: <p>This state park has a lot to do with camping at Cascadia campground, swimming in the Santiam River and a short hike to the long thin Lower Soda Creek Falls.</p><p>It used to be the location of a hotel and resort back in 1896, based on the &ldquo;curative powers&rdquo; of the mineral spring water along Soda Creek. Visitors trekked to the remote spot to drink from the bubbling spring. At the height of the resort&rsquo;s popularity in the early 1900s, an average of 1,000 people a week stayed at the hotel and in the camping area. If you look closely you can find a pipe with the orange spring water still flowing out.</p><p>The main campground has 25 first-come, first served tent sites tucked into the trees and rhododendrons. Two reservable group tent areas are near the South Santiam River. If you only have time for a short visit, there are plenty of picnic tables in two day-use areas. Drinking water is available in all areas, as well as flush toilets.</p><p>Look for a small trailhead sign and a bench as you drive into the main day-use parking area. This is the take-off point for a 3/4-mile trail that leads to the 150-foot Soda Creek waterfall. The dirt trail is moderately steep. Look for several varieties of ferns, wildflowers and big Douglas-fir, cedar and maple trees. </p>
tips: <p>To get here take Hwy 20 14 miles east of Sweet Home.  Between milepost 41 and 42 look for the Cascadia State Park sign and turn north across a bridge.  Keep right and park at the picnic area. </p>
