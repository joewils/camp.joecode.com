title: Crater Lake, Mt. Scott Standard Summit Route
seo_title: crater-lake-mt-scott-standard-summit-route
sub_title: Via Southwest Ridge with optional ski descent
overview: <p>A super fun and easy ascent of Mt. Scott, the highest point of Crater Lake.  We did this with skis and got a lot of funny looks from the people in shorts hiking up besides us in sneakers in July.  But, we had a fun little descent from the ridge down the remaining snowfields while drinking a few beers on the way up.  You'll have amazing views of the lake below.  Enjoy! </p>
tips: <p>Just head to Crater Lake in Oregon.  It's on the Eastern side of the lake.  You won't miss it.  There is of course a $20 fee to get into the National Park. </p>
