importantInformation: '<p>Beverly Beach State Park can be reached at (541) 265-9278. Welcome to Beverly Beach State Park. We now have a day use meeting hall (large yurt) available. Oregon State law requires that anyone under the age of 16 must wear a bicycle helmet when riding bikes, scooters, skate boards and roller blades. ********** Campground Policies ********** Only one vehicle is included with each individual campsite reservation. A second vehicle is $5.00 per night (changing to $7.00 per night May 1, 2014), paid at the park upon arrival, and is permitted only if both vehicles have all wheels on pavement pad. This is to protect natural resources. Two motorized vehicles maximum allowed per site. This includes tow vehicle. Additional extra vehicles must park in a designated area away from the campsite and pay a $5.00 per vehicle, per night fee. Please do not dump a full holding tank into the campsite connection as it may overflow. Use the dump station located near the registration booth. Winter closures: G and H loops will be closed to reservations October 1 through mid March due to seasonal flooding. Sites may be available for first come, first serve campers. Most tent sites in loops C through F are closed October through April. *Reservations for more than five nights/days that are later changed to fewer nights/days will be charged a fee equal to the nightly/daily site fee for each night/day canceled as well as the $8 transaction fee. Please be aware that only the person whose name is on the reservation may access, change or cancel the reservation. You can stay 14 consecutive nights in a single campground, and may return after spending at least three nights out of the park (it can be another state park campground; in fact, we recommend you DO select another state park campground). The maximum time allowed within any Oregon State Park is 14 nights within any 17 night period. Customers who wish to secure more than one site within a park for a continuous date period in order to accommodate their reservation request (i.e. split reservation), should be aware that the $8.00 reservation fee would apply to each site reserved. Reservation fee adjustments will not be made after reservations have been confirmed using the internet reservation service. If you are viewing inventory and find you are unable to secure one site to accommodate your request please consider calling the call center at 1-800-452-5687 to make your reservation. Discount programs which may be offered through the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department cannot be processed when making an internet reservation. For additional information on discount programs call the OPRD Information Center at 1-800-551-6949 or visit us online at www.OregonStateParks.org. Reservations can be made 24 hours a day, from 2 days to 9 months in advance. Campsite availability is based on call center hours, meaning sites become available when the call center opens. Call center hours are: Monday through Friday 8am to 5pm. </p>'
