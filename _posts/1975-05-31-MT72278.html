orientationDescription: <p>The cabin is nestled in Swan Valley just west of the Bob Marshall Wilderness. It sits about five miles east of the Swan River. From the front porch, guests can see views of the Mission Mountains across an open field. Behind the cabin is a stand of towering mixed pine trees and Simpson Creek flows nearby.</p><p> Part of a historic Forest Service compound, the ranger&amp;#39;s residence was constructed in the early 1920s and later restored for public use. Historically, the site was used year round to operate the Condon Ranger District, which has been renamed as the Swan Lake Ranger District. The work center was relocated in the 1960s, but some structures remain to remind visitors of the old Forest Service days.</p>
