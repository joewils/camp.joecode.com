sub_title: 'Tide pools, waterfalls, moss covered forests, rugged bluffs, crashing waves, sandy beaches, jaw dropping scenery... '
overview: <p>A true hidden gem! The more time you have, the more you will discover. The trails are easy, but not maintained, so keep that in mind. All of the trails with beach access will be steep due to the rugged bluffs and cliffs that make the area so beautiful. Trinidad Head parking lot is the easiest way to access the beach directly. </p>
tips: <p>This is an un-maintained FREE public access state forest/beach. TSB has spectacular views all year round, crashing swells in the winter, morning fog and daily sunshine in summer, lush greenery in spring/summer, dry clear days in fall. The trails can be muddy in winter but the rain usually lets up for plenty of hiking time. Elk Head is perfect for whale watching in spring/fall. </p>
