sub_title: 'This hiking trail loops all the way around Clear Lake along the scenic McKenzie Highway in Oregon. '
overview: <p>Clear Lake, the &quot;lake born of fire&quot;, is the headwaters of the McKenzie River and was formed 3000 years ago when lava from Sand Mountain reached the river and backed up water to form the lake.</p><p>The original forest that had lined the river banks was submerged. Remnants of some of these submerged trees still stand under 120 feet of water and are visible from the trail and by boat. The nearly freezing temperature of the lake makes it unsuitable for swimming.</p><p>Osprey and bald eagles, and native cutthroat trout call the lake home. Non-native rainbow and brook trout are also found in the lake.</p><p>Clear Lake is popular for fishing, canoeing and boating. No motors are allowed on the lake. The Clear Lake Loop Trail is open to both hikers and mountain bikes. </p>
tips: <p>You will find Clear Lake on Hwy 126 3 miles south of the Hwy 20/126 junction.  If coming from Eugene/Springfield go roughly 64 miles East of Springfield (18 miles east of McKenzie Bridge)on Hwy 126.</p><p>From Portland/Salem take the Detroit Lakes Hwy 22 roughly 80 miles to the Santiam Junction. Go west on Hwy 20 for 3.5 miles and turn left on Hwy 126 for 3 miles.</p><p>Make sure you bring plenty of water and sun block lotion, as some of the trail goes through lava fields where the sun can get very hot. </p>
