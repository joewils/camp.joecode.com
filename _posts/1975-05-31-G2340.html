sub_title: 'Easy hike through Douglas Fir and Hemlock to Henline Falls and remnants of old mining from the 1930''s.  '
overview: <p>The trail meanders through young Douglas-fir and Western Hemlock forest. The trail ends at Henline Falls. Here you will find remnants of old mining from the 1930's. A mine adit was built into the solid rock wall and goes back in about 1500 feet.</p><p>However, recently it has been gated off at about 100 feet, which is disappointing.  Would be fun to explore further back into the dark.</p><p>Another thing to note, the mine is a bit difficult to get up to for little kids, and they will need a hand so they don't fall especially if the rock is wet (not really that dangerous just be careful) </p>
tips: <p>From Salem, travel East on Hwy 22 to milepost 23 at the Swiss Village Restaurant. Turn left on North Fork Road, which is marked &quot;Little North Santiam Recreation Area&quot;. Travel about 19 miles to forest road 2207 junction, continue past this junction for &frac14; mile. Trailhead is on the left side. </p>
