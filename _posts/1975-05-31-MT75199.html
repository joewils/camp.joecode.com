description: <p>Fox Creek Cabin is a former ranger station located in a remote area. It is very small and offers only basic amenities. Guests will need to bring most of the gear and supplies they need to have a comfortable and enjoyable stay.</p><p> The cabin is located in a non-motorized area and can only be accessed by a 2.5-mile hike during the summer months, from the end of Langohr Road. A four-wheel drive vehicle is recommended for driving on Langohr Road. Winter access to the cabin requires hiking, skiing or snowshoeing about six miles from the South Cottonwood Trailhead.</p>
drivingDirection: '<p>Summer Access from Hyalite Canyon: From Main Street in Bozeman, drive down South 19th for approximately 7 miles to Hyalite Canyon Road 62. Turn left and proceed up the canyon. (Hyalite Canyon Road is not plowed in the winter). Continue about 6 miles to Langohr Road 1046, just past the Langohr Campground. Turn right and proceed about 4 miles to a fork in the road. Take the left fork, which leads to a switchback and climb through a clear-cut with the last section getting fairly rough and rutted. The clear-cut ends at the top of the ridge between Hyalite and South Cottonwood. Park at the small opening, off to the left. Just before the ridge top, a spur trail with a large dirt hump in the middle heads back to the south to meet the main History Rock Trail 424. At the History Rock Trail, turn right (southwest) and continue 2.5 miles. The trail forks just before South Cottonwood Creek. Go left at the fork and watch for cabin signs. Cross Fox Creek at the bottom on a footbridge, but do not cross South Cottonwood Creek. Staying to the left is a good rule for finding the cabin and staying on the trail. After the new bridge, follow the trail through the woods another 50 yards to the meadow and go left. The cabin is in the woods back toward the drainage you just came down (it cannot be seen from themeadow). Winter Access from South Cottonwood: Hike, snowshoe or cross-country ski approximately 6 miles up the South Cottonwood Trail 422. Cross the big meadow a half-mile from the trailhead and continue another half-mile more to the History Rock Trail junction. Don&apos;t turn east until the sign is visible. Where the South Cottonwood Trail intersects with the History Rock Trail 424, take the History Rock Trail east for a short distance and cross a footbridge following a new trail route up away from the creek; the trail shortly intersects with the old History Rock Trail and a cabin sign should be pointing right. Follow the trail to a footbridge across Fox Creek and go left in the meadow after the bridge. The cabin is in the woods and difficult to see, so keep to the left, away from the creek, in order to find it.  </p>'
facilitiesDescription: <p>The cabin has bunk beds with mattresses to accommodate up to two people. A small wood stove can be used for heating and cooking. A table with  chairs, basic cookware, dishes, utensils and cleaning equipment are provided. An outhouse is equipped with a vault toilet.</p><p>Electricity and water are not provided. Guests must bring their own water supply and flashlights or lanterns. Guests should also bring their own bedding, dish soap, toilet paper, garbage bags and other supplies. The cabin will need to be cleaned and all trash carried out prior to departure.</p>

orientationDescription: <p>The cabin sits at an elevation of approximately 6,700 feet, next to South Cottonwood Creek in the midst of the Gallatin Mountain Range.

Birders may see a wide variety of bird  species.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The South Cottonwood and History Rock Trails are used to access the cabin and are available for hiking, mountain biking, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing, depending on the conditions. Both trails connect to the Mount Blackmore Loop Trail, which offers views of the Hyalite Canyon at the summit of Mount Blackmore before descending to  Blackmore Lake.</p><p>Fishing is  possible in the area, as well as hunting in the fall.</p>
