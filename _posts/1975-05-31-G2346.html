sub_title: A moderate hike to three waterfalls and a fun swimming hole.
overview: <p>The interesting thing about this hike to twin waterfalls is that it starts at the top of the hills and heads downhill, which means you must hike back uphill for the second half of the hike.</p><p>As you hike down you will pass by Upper Kentucky Falls then down to the twin falls of Lower Kentucky Falls and North Fork Falls, where there is a nice wooden viewpoint.</p><p>If you continue down the trail along the North Fork of the Smith River you can find a nice swimming hole.  However, last time I was here the trail was REALLY overgrown. </p>
tips: '<p>From Reedsport, go north on Hwy 101 across bridge then make immediate right onto Road #48 (North Fork Road).  Go 15.9 miles then turn left onto 48A North Fork Rd.  Go 10.6 miles, then turn right onto Road #23.  Go 9.6 miles then turn left onto Road 919, continue for 2.7 miles to the trailhead. </p><p>From Eugene, take  Highway 126 west for 33.0 miles.  Between mileposts 26 and 27, turn south at &ldquo;Whittaker Cr. Rec. Area&rdquo; sign.  In 1.6 miles, turn right across a bridge at another Whittaker Creek sign.  Follow this road for 1.5 miles, then fork to the left onto Dunn Ridge Road.  Continue for 7.0 miles to a T-shaped junction at the end of the pavement.  Turn left on Knowles Creek Road and continue for 2.7 miles.  Turn right onto Road # 23.  After 1.6 miles, turn right onto Road #919.  After 2.8 miles, turn right into the parking area. </p>'
