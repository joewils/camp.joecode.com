importantInformation: '<p> This is NOT a State Park. This is a Metro Regional Park. Pets are not allowed in the park, including inside vehicles. Fireworks, alcohol and all other intoxicants are prohibited. Maximum of 6 people and 2 vehicles per site. No overflow parking. No accommodations will be made for additional vehicles overnight. Vehicle fee: $5 ($7 for large vans or buses), required on first day. Park gates are locked each evening at official sunset (time is posted at park entrance) and open each morning at 6:30 am. In case of after hour emergencies, gate directions are posted at the office. Pull-through sites are restricted to use by RVs or trailers only. Sites 10-22 will be closed November 1st through March 31, 2014. *Reservations for more than five nights/days that are later changed to fewer nights/days will be charged a fee equal to the nightly/daily site fee for each night/day canceled as well as the $8 transaction fee. Please be aware that only the person whose name is on the reservation may access, change or cancel the reservation. Maximum camping days are 14 consecutive days. Campers must leave for three days and may return an additional 14 days. Twenty-eight total days is the maximum for any six-month period. Customers who wish to secure more than one site within a park for a continuous date period in order to accommodate their reservation request (i.e. split reservation), should be aware that the $8.00 reservation fee would apply to each site reserved. Again, fee adjustments will not be made after reservations have been confirmed using the internet reservation service. If you are viewing inventory and find you are unable to secure one site to accommodate your request please consider calling the call center at 1-800-452-5687 to make your reservation. Reservations can be made 24 hours a day, from 2 days to 9 months in advance. Campsite availability is based on call center hours, meaning sites become available when the call center opens giving no preference to online users versus phone-in customers. Call center hours are: Monday through Friday 8am to 5pm. </p>'
