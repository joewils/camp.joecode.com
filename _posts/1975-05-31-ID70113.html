The area is known for its dense forests of lodgepole pine, broad grassy meadows bursting with summer wildflowers and a wide variety of wildlife, including black and grizzly bears, moose, elk, deer, bald eagles, Sandhill cranes and much, much more.</p><p> A mixed growth of lodgepole pine forest provides partial shade. A portion of one loop is fairly close to the river and some sites have river views.</p>
