note: ''
orientationDescription: <p>Paulina Lake is located within the collapsed crater, or &quot;caldera&quot; of Newberry Volcano.  Nearly five miles in diameter, this caldera encircles the basins of Paulina Lake, and its twin, East Lake. Covering an area of 1,531 acres, Paulina Lake, the larger and deeper of the two, plunges to depths of 250 feet.</p><p> Neither lake receives water from an inlet stream, but instead, are fed solely by rain, snowmelt, and hot springs.  Paulina Creek drains the lake and has chiseled a narrow gorge through the caldera&amp;#39;s west wall creating a remarkable twin waterfall.</p><p>  Thermal vents and hot springs along the lake&amp;#39;s northeast edge help create a highly productive ecosystem.</p><p> Wetlands, diverse forests, and rocky slopes near the campground provide a necessary habitat for shorebirds, racoon, deer, bats, and the occasional black bear.</p><p> In September, the outlet of Paulina Lake may become choked with kokanee salmon swimming to spawn in Paulina Creek.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The unique location of Newberry Group Campground offers outdoor enthusiasts fantastic opportunities for bird watching, boating, bicycling, sightseeing and hiking throughout the year.</p><p>  Bird watchers may catch a glimpse of bald eagles and osprey nesting nearby. Common loon, Grebe, Tundra swan, Eurasian wigeon, American wigeon, Ring-necked duck, Goldeneye, and Hooded Merganser are lured to Paulina Lake as well.</p><p>  Visitors can drive or hike to the summit of nearby Paulina Peak to watch soaring raptors such as golden eagle, turkey vulture, prairie falcon and red-tailed hawk.</p>
