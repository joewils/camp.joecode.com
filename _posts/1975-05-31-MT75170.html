description: <p>Trail Creek Cabin, built in 1924, was the original ranger station for the Bozeman Ranger District. It is available from June through March, offering guests the  chance to enjoy summer or winter recreation.</p><p>The cabin is located in a remote area that is not accessible by car. Guests must travel on foot, horseback, off-road vehicle or mountain bike, or, in winter, on skis, snowshoes or snowmobile  to reach the cabin.
