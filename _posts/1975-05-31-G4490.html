seo_title: beaver-and-cattail-ponds-trail-william-l-finley-refuge
sub_title: Take this loop hike with very little elevation gain around two ponds filled with waterfowl.
overview: <p>This is a nice loop hike around two ponds where you have a great chance of seeing herons, ospreys and a variety of waterfowl.  The trail is very flat and during the spring months or after a rainfall can be very muddy so bring old shoes.   </p>
tips: <p>From Corvallis Follow Hwy 99 south for about 11.2 miles from Avery Ave until you see Bruce Road on the right. Take that road and drive a mile or so until you see the parking area on the right. </p>
