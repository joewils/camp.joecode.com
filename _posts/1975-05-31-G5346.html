overview: <p>Table Rock is at 4881 feet, offers some incredible views of the Cascades. Here is my track from July 2, 2011. Just under 8 miles and 2900 feet of elevation gained, some of which was goofing around some of the different rock outcroppings. The first 1.5 miles of the hike are on an old logging road,You will come to a landslide that wiped out part of the road, just work your way around it up through the trees and then work your way back down to the road. Go about another mile and keep your eyes open for the old trail on your right, its usually marked with rock piles. Once you are on this trail your next turn will be at the saddle, you can turn left to go to Table Rock or right to go out to Rooster rock. Be sure to be prepared for weather conditions, there was still some lingering snow to deal with on the North side and in some of the shady pockets, makes for some fun route finding... The trails are marked occasionally with ribbon and even some old blazes on the trees to help find the way if the snow covers the trail. </p>
tips: <p>From the town of Molalla take highway 211 East, follow the signs to Frier Park 1.96 miles. Cross the Molalla River at Frier Park and turn right in Dickie Prairie Rd 1.6 miles, turn right at the Dickie Prairie store and go about 3.5 miles to the Glen Avon Bridge turn right. Follow the Molalla River 13 miles and you will start seeing signs for Table Rock trailhead turn left on to road 7-3E-14. Stay on this road for another 2.5 miles and take a right on to road 7-3E-7. That was your last turn, just 4 more miles to the trailhead. </p>
