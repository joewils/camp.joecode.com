  seo_title: mt-adams-standard-summit-route-ski-descent
  sub_title: Via Cold Springs and South Spur
  overview: <p>This is a challenging climb up a 12,000 foot volcano in southern Washington.   You'll climb close to 7,000 feet for this ski descent.  When you get up to the base of the glacier it will look like a highway of climbers in spring and summer months.  Hope for good snow as the descent is fantastic.  Beware - there is a false summit so be prepared to be disappointed as you crest what you think is the top, only to have to hike another half mile or so.  When you ski down get some speed from the true top and you might be able to make it partly up the false summit. </p>
  tips: <p>Take highway 141 north from White Salmon through Hood River approx. 22 miles to Trout Lake.  From 1 mile north of the town go 1 mile on forest service road 23, then onto FS 80 on the right.  Stay on 80, then onto 8040 following signs for Cold Springs Campground.  The trail is on the north side of the campground.   You need obtain a climbing permit from the Trout Lake Ranger Station for $15.00 to park at Cold Springs and to climb. </p>

  sub_title: 'Get a panoramic view of the devastation from the Mt. St. Helen''s Crater, to Spirit lake and beyond. Not to be missed! '
  overview: <p>This is an incredible route for getting a sense of the total devastation from the 1980 eruption. You'll hike with the crater in front of you or on your right most the way, then turn towards the east mountains as you make your way to Harry's Ridge. From Harry's Ridge you'll view the crater, Spirit Lake with logs from the eruption still sliding across the lake back and forth with the wind, and on up towards the furthest parts of the damage. </p><p>Along the way, in the right season, you'll find berries and wildlife. If you're lucky, you'll return as the Elk head off the mountain into the valley to feed and rest for the night - they'll be on your right most the way back. </p>
  tips: '<p>Total time on the trail includes plenty of dawdling: taking pictures, relaxing on Harry''s Ridge, watching the sunset &amp; the elk feeding. Easily a couple hours could be saved off for the focused hiker. Also, there''s a part of the trail early on that has a lengthy piece of trail on a steep gravely mountainside - not the best if you fear heights or have kids probably. Take care when passing others.Trip begins at Johnston Ridge Observatory and ends at Parking Lot. </p>'

  overview: <p>A great hike from the Johnston Ridge Observatory, across the pumice planes in the devastated area destroyed in the 1980 eruption, and part of the way up the mountain to beautiful Loowit Falls.</p><p>Mt. St. Helens is in Washington State.  It's about sixty miles off highway five about 70 miles from Porland and about a hundred and fifty miles south of Seattle.  It can be reached from the south, the west, and the northwest sides.  Once a 9,700 ft cone-shaped stratovolcano, Mt. St. Helens erupted in 1980 sending an ash cloud thousands of feet high. the explosion blew off the top and north side of the mountain, and devastated the forests for miles.  The mountain is now a national monument and a research site on the re-emergence of a forest from complete annihilation. Thirty years later, moss covers the ground as far as the eye can see, wildflowers bloom as tiny streams weave their way across the plains, and tiny trees and bushes sprout up from the soil in a reminder to us all that life will find a way.</p><p>The hike to Loowit Falls is an all day hike, 8.5 miles one way!  Get started early and bring a headlamp just in case you get back during the evening. </p>
  tips: <p>Bring lots of water and sunscreen because there is no shade on this hike.  Get up early because this is a full day hike and you will be running up against darkness if the going is slow.  Bring a headlamp just in case. </p>

  overview: |-
    <p>All St. Helens trips start out at the Lone Fir Resort the night prior to hiking to pick up the permits. The weather  forecast should be checked prior to climbing. It's best to start early morning at the climbers bivouc.  The climb rises steadily as you go up in altitude. The wind and the altitude can affect many climbers but as with all physical activity being in shape to attempt this climb is a must. At the summit, you have amazing views as long as there are no clouds.  glisading makes the trip much faster coming down as long as there is enough snow. Great trip overall.
    recommend climbing in spring or early summer right around the time that the Climbers Bivouc opens. </p>
  tips: <p>plan this trip&nbsp;in advance and bring the correct equipment as another group that day found out the hard way. (lost 2 hikers that were not prepared to spend the night on the mountian) side note. Both were found 5:30am the next morning hungry and cold but safe. </p>

  overview: <p>You begin your hike at the Marble Mountain Snow Park.  In the attached gps track the road wasn't plowed all the way to the park so we started skinning on the forest road a couple miles before the actual parking area.  This is a terrific ski descent in which you can keep your skis and skins on all the way to the rim of the blown out volcano.  Then click your heels in or free-heel it down the worm flows back to the car.  It is definitely a full day experience but is a good backcountry ski for beginners or those that don't like climbing steeps.  Make sure to stay away from the volcano edge as people have definitely broken off overhanging cornices and have fallen in to their deaths. </p>
  tips: |-
    <p>$15 climbing fee required above 4800 ft from April 1 to Oct 31 .  Free in the winter, but stay away from cornices at all times of years as people have fallen in! A Northwest Forest Pass is required for parking or a Snow-Park permit from November to April.  </p><p>Directions to snow-park:

The trail almost immediately turns eastward as it gains elevation steadily for a quarter mile or so. Watch for a spur trail to the left just before the main trail turns southward. The spur decends sharply down to a to a great East-facing viewpoint. Leash pets and take little ones by the hand, as there are a few sharp drop-offs.</p><p>Return to the main trail as it again starts climbing moderately steeply for the next mile or so. You will cross a talus slope a few times as the long sweeping switchbacks cross it. Eventually the trail levels out to a forest with a high canopy. You are nearing the summit at this point. Continue another 1/4 mile and you'll come across a large sign describing the cultural and historical significance of this mountain as a spirit quest site.</p><p>The sign informs you that sections of the summit are closed to hikers:</p><p>This archaelogical site is extremely fragile. Just walking over it will damage important cultural features. Therefore, the USDA Forest Service has closed the site to hikers. All visitors must stay on the trail or within designated areas shown on the map.</p><p>It isn't long before you reach the summit. The summit does not have a 360 view, but you'll find the designated viewing areas afford you spectactular views to the East and to the West. Looking East you have a great perspective of Dog Mountain. To the south across the Columbia River you will see Mitchell Point. Following the horizon toward the East you see Mount Defiance, the highest mountain in the gorge.</p><p>Looking West down the Columbia River you might spot Indian Point, a rock sphire along the Oregon side. On the Washingon side, due West you will be Table Mountain and Greenleaf Peak. On a clear day, look to your Northwest and spot Mount Saint Helens. </p>

The trail is easy to follow all the way to Noble Knob around Mutton Mountain which you can also run up if you'd like.  This trail is open to mountain bikers if you are interested... </p>
  tips: |-
    <p>Directions to Trailhead:
    From the intersection with WA 167 and WA 410 drive 30 miles north on 410 to the Corral Pass forest service road.  Take this all the way up to the trailhead for trail #1184.  I don't believe there is a fee to park here. </p>

  seo_title: mt-clemen-waterworks-canyon
  sub_title: Easy to start, challenging to finish.  Be prepared to scramble talus and negotiate underbrush!
  overview: <p>The lower part of this trail is overwhelmingly deceptive.  There is a decent parking area that is well enough removed from the highway, and the trail-head is usually in good shape.  Unfortunately, the &quot;trail&quot; only goes about half-way up the hill.  After crossing under the brush a few times, the trail kind of disappears and leaves the hiker with the options of following game-trails, forging their own, or just turning around.  </p><p>The game trails (if you can find/follow them) are usually a relatively safe option, but will quite often involve some talus-slope scrambling.  It is usually easier on the ascent to just climb up to a ridge and follow it up to the summit rather than staying in the canyon itself.  Of course, the decent is more of the same nastiness of sorting out the &quot;easiest&quot; path back down through the talus and brush.</p><p>The views from the top are excellent, and worth the effort on a clear day.  And the overall distance and grade of the hike is great training for higher elevation mountains (it is a similar profile to the climb from Paradise-to-Muir on Rainier. </p><p>If you have an adventurous dog who will go anywhere, this is a good challenging hike to wear them out.  If your dog has soft/sensitive feet, is prone to getting brush stuck in their fur, or is nervous scrambling on loose rock, it would be better to leave them at home. </p>
  tips: <p>Bring plenty of water.  Although the name is &quot;Waterworks Canyon,&quot; the water in the canyon can be quite sparse, and almost non-existent on the upper part of the hike.  You can filter water from the stream, but only if it was water in it (not likely in late summer)!</p><p>Be Prepared for ticks and rattlesnakes.  Both are quite common along the trail. </p>

  seo_title: bandera-mountain
  sub_title: An Alpine Treat Above the Clouds, Great Seattle Hike
  overview: |-
    <p>Late summer days in the Seattle area often begin with a thick layer of gloomy clouds. So you can head east through the I-90 corridor, into the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, to climb above the clouds. Bandera Mountain on the western edge of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area is an excellent place to find the sun and enjoy panoramic views of glacial history written in the rocks of the Cascade Mountains.</p><p>The trail up to the summit of Bendera Mountain is 3.3 miles in length (and the same distance back; total 6.6 miles) with an elevation gain of 3048 feet for a final elevation of 5256 feet (according to my GPS). The last 1.5 miles of the trail gain 1800 feet by cutting straight up the mountain on a narrow path (2 feet wide in most places), the last .5 mile gaining 1000 feet. Difficult as this last leg is, the view at the top, and the feeling of accomplishment is not to be denied.
    Take Interstate 90 east and get off at Exit 45 (Road No. 9030). At the stop sign, turn left, go under the freeway to Forest Service Road No. 9030. Drive about a half-mile to a road junction and continue straight about three miles on Road No. 9031 to trailhead parking and facilities, elevation about 2,300 feet. Allow about an hour drive time from Seattle. A Northwest Forest Pass is required. </p>
  tips: |-
    <p>1. Take plenty of water. After you cross the creek, early in the hike, there are no water sources along the trail to the top.
    2. Hiking/trekking poles will give you an advantage, especially as you ascend and descend the half mile to the top and back.
    3. Use mosquito repellent! This creature may be the state bird of Alaska and Minnesota, but you&rsquo;ll find it in abundance at the top of the mountain. Since few people actually make the ascent to the top, all of them are voracious. </p>

  title: The Enchantments
  seo_title: the-enchantments
  sub_title: 'The first comprehensive guide to The Enchantments... including photos, side trips, camps, even toilets! '
  overview: '<p>This is THE backpacking destination in the state of Washington.  Wander through soft tundra meadows, glacial-cirque lakes, crystal clear trickling streams, and impossible granite rock formations in the heart of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness.  It will make you feel like you''re in a completely different part of the world.</p><p>Note that you MUST have a permit to camp in this area and they are distributed months in advance, so plan ahead and see below for more info.</p><p>This area is thought to be discovered by A.H. Sylvester, who was originally a topographer for the USGS but went on to supervise Wenatchee National Forest starting in 1908.  Climbers didn''t start enjoying this area for recreation until the late 1940''s.  [100 Hikes in Washington''s Alpine Lakes (1st ed.), Spring, Ira; Manning, Harvey, 1993] And the permit system, designed to protect the area from destructive humans, was not put in place until 1981.</p><p>The big question is: which side to enter from?  The Snow Lake entrance is longer, more gradual, and less scenic.  The Colchuck Lake entrance is shorter and steeper (maybe even slippery and dangerous), but Colchuck Lake is beautiful.  The traditional entrance would be Snow Lake because this side brings you through the Enchantments &quot;in order,&quot; meaning you start in the Lower Enchantments and work your way up to the Upper Enchantments.</p><p>It''s your choice, but this guide is written assuming you''re hiking in from Snow Lake, all the way through the Enchantments, and out the Colchuck Lake side.</p><p>The permit lottery system might actually decide this for you based on what zones you''re allowed to camp in!</p><p>We''ve actually seem some individuals more on the &quot;hard&quot; end of the spectrum that will do this entire through-hike in one day.  If you have a light pack, it''s possible, but bring a headlamp and enough food and gear to spend the night if you have to.</p><p>I included some waypoints for good campsites and toilets which will hopefully help you plan your nights and your morning coffee.  By no means are these ALL of the campsites and toilets, but I''ve included some that I think are pretty nice.  Oh yes, some of the toilets up here in the Enchantments are truly amazing because of the views they offer.  But probably a more complete reference for campsites and toilets is the paper map that you pick up with your camping permit at the ranger station in Leavenworth.</p><p>No fires or dogs up here.  But there will be enough scenery to keep you company. </p>'
  tips: '<p>I recommend an overnight trip that''s at least two nights, hopefully three.  For this, you''ll need a permit, which is not easy to get.</p><p>Applications for permits are accepted starting in February each year.  There is an art to applying because you can be as flexible as you want with dates and locations.  It''s always a balancing act between trying to get the right time of year and making sure you actually get a permit.  You usually know by March/April if you &quot;scored&quot; and are permitted camp up there.  Permits are broken out by Zones: Core Enchantments, Snow Lake, and Colchuck Lake.  Even if you don''t get the Core Enchantments, you can still really enjoy the area by keeping camp at Snow or Colchuck Lakes.</p><p>If you don''t get one, show up at the Leavenworth Ranger Station at 7:45 AM Mon-Sat to see if you can get lucky and grab from the small daily lottery.  If you still fail, it''s probably worth waiting until after 9 AM, when they start handing out unclaimed reserved permits.</p><p>Watch out for mice at your campsite.  Get all your food bagged up and airtight.  Hang it up in a tree if you want.  They probably won''t get into unopened Mountain House meals and I''ve seen heavy-duty Ziploc bags (fully airtight) cloak the smell of food so they didn''t take interest.  But they can and will chew through the material of your backpack to get to food that they can smell from the outside. </p>'

  overview: <p>This popular trail follows the South Fork of the Snoqualmie River through the rainforests along the western edge of the Cascade Mountains. The trail provides spectacular views of Twin Falls. Most people park at the Twin Falls Trailhead located off of Exit 34 on I-90. A little over a mile from the trailhead, a set of stairs descends to a viewpoint of the Lower Falls as they plunge over a 150 foot cliff. Hike another quarter mile to a bridge that spans the narrow Twin Falls canyon. From the bridge you can see several plunge pools of the Upper Falls upstream and the edge of the Lower Falls downstream. Less than a quarter mile from the bridge is a view of the Upper Falls from above. Most visitors turn around at this point as the trail starts climbing steeply. Those hearty enough to continue will find that, the trail intersects with the John Wayne Pioneer Trail in a little under a mile. The John Wayne Pioneer Trail is a 108 mile long trail that follows the old Chicago-Milwaukee-St. Paul-Pacific Railroad from Cedar Falls to Vantage. Hike east along the Pioneer Trail for a quarter mile to reach the Olallie State Park Homestead Valley Trailhead (located off I-90 Exit 38). </p>
  tips: <p>Discover Pass is required.</p><p>Dogs on leash.</p><p>Avoid the summer crowds by visiting on a weekday.</p><p>Parking at the trailhead is limited. </p>

  overview: <p>Stuart Lake is at 5600 feet elevation in the Enchantment Mountain range. It is about a 30 acre lake with clear water and easy fishing access in many places. The lake has a very healthy population of gorgeous cutthroat trout.</p><p>The trail to the lake is well marked and well used. It follows Mountaineer Creek for over 3 miles, at which time you start getting great views of the Enchantment Mountain Range. The elevation gain to Lake Stuart is 1700 feet, but spread out over 5 miles, it really is not a very tough hike.</p><p>Mount Stuart rises above you at the southwest end of the lake with Sherpa Peak to its east.</p><p>You make wish to make a side trip up to Colchuck Lake, but do know that this hike is strenuous, but the payoff is worth it. </p>
  tips: <p>Take I-90 and head east over Snoqualmie Pass to Cle Elum, taking the exit to Wenatchee &amp; Blewett Pass via 970 and then US highway 97. Highway 97 takes you over Blewett pass to a junction with U.S. 2. Turn left towards Leavenworth.  From milepost 99 on US 2, on the western end of Leavenworth, follow the paved Icicle Creek Road (Forest Road 76) for 8.4 miles, turn left onto Eightmile Road (FR 7601). Continue on this washboarded dirt road for 3.8 miles to a parking lot and the trailhead.</p><p>You will need a permit if you plan to camp overnight anywhere in the area (you do not need a permit for a day hike beyond the self-issue permit at the trailhead). Failure to have a permit will result in you being fined and asked to leave by the rangers.</p><p>No Dogs are allowed on the trail and no fires are allowed at either lake. </p>

I hiked this trail on a rainy weekend in the spring so water levels were high (high enough for kayakers to run the canyon beneath us).  I suggest doing this hike in the spring or early summer as well to really appreciate the beautiful waterfalls. </p>

  overview: '<p>Beacon Rock is a the core of an ancient volcano.  Over thousands of years, hundreds of massive floods (originating in Missoula Montana) careened through the Columbia River Gorge and carved away the volcano''s main structure, leaving only the lava core we see today.  Depending on the definition and expert you talk to, it is the second largest free standing monolith in the northern hemisphere!</p><p>The trail up Beacon Rock is short and manageable for day-hikers of all ages, at just under a mile each direction.  It is well maintained, although not paved most the way.</p><p>BACKGROUND:  Beacon Rock is 848 feet (258 m) tall and is composed of Basalt. The United States Army Corps of Engineers planned to destroy the rock to supply material for the jetty at the mouth of the ColumbiaIn.  In 1915 Henry Biddle purchased the rock for $1 and over the next three years constructed the switchbacks and trail, most of which is still in use today.  After his death, Biddle''s family tried to make it a state park. At first Washington refused the gift, but changed its position when Oregon offered to accept. </p>'
  tips: "<p>Expect wind at the base and top, but it is generally calm on the way up...so don't be fooled into over-dressing...the hike WILL warm you up!

  tips: <p>From the Portland area, take I-84 east to the third Hood River Exit (exit 64), cross the Hood River Bridge to Washington, and turn right (east) on Hwy. 14. Go about 13 miles to the Klickitat River Bridge (the entrance to Lyle). From Lyle, take the paved Lyle-Centerville Hwy., which starts in the center of Lyle between the gas station and the Cafe. Head north and east for approximately 15 miles. Turn left on Harms Rd. Drive north one-half mile and park just north of the bridge. </p><p>There is a portable toilet at this location. </p><p>Bring along binoculars for bird/groundhog watching.</p><p>Bring sunscreen as much of the trail is uncovered. </p>

  overview: <p>This is a difficult, but rewarding day hike.  Start out from the parking lot and hike through the dense, cool forest.  After a short while, you will emerge from the forest into a meadow.  Cross a stream and continue through the meadow to an alpine area that is quite rocky.  The trail is always apparent until you approach the bottom of the last climb to the fire lookout.  You will need to go left here until you see the beautiful blue hues of Hidden Lake and scramble up the rocky backside.  Watch your step!  One could easily spend a full day on this hike.  The views are breath-taking. </p>
  tips: '<p>A good time to go is August or September after the snow is gone.  Bugs can be annoying in the meadows and trekking poles are always help that the knees need.  To get to the trailhead:  Take highway 20 to Marblemount and when the road turns left, go straight over the bridge.  This is Cascade River Road.  You will see a sign for Hidden Lake Peaks.  Turn and follow that road to the trailhead.  If you go to far, you will end up at the trail head for Sahale Arm (which is another amazing hike!).  The route is 3.7 miles one-way.  Once you are out of the trees, you will be blasted by the sun so bring sun screen. </p>'

  overview: <p>Start out at Lime Kiln Trail head, south east of Granite Falls, Washington.  Trail goes briefly through the forest to a mostly level road, before gently declining through the forest to follow the South Fork of the Stillaguamish river.  At one point you pass by Hubbard Lake and cross a bridge over Hubbard Creek.  Continue on the trail with peek-a boo views of the river.  Keep your eye out for relics left behind from the Everett- Monte Cristo railway.  Please leave relics as they are found for others to enjoy.  After descending a short hill the trail turns and follows the Stillaguamish along the original railroad grade.  Eventually you will come to the Lime Kiln located on the right side of the trail.  you can continue  almost a mile to where the remnant of the railroad bridge is located, at this point you can also take the loop which will drop you down to the river bank, or return to the trail head. For additional information on this trail and others nearby please visit http://www.robecanyon.org/ </p>
  tips: <p>At some points on this trail it would be important to closely watch young children, as there are drop offs and a slippery log bridge.  If you take the river loop, and the water is low enough there is a nice beach to rest at. </p>

  sub_title: Swirling Fog / Rushing Tides
  overview: '<p>Overview: Looking for a safe harbor? Smooth waters? So was Captain James Vancouver in June of 1798. So he sent Ship&rsquo;s Master Joseph Whidbey with a crew in a small boat around the northeastern tip of what was later named Whidbey Island to search for the inner waterway to Port Gardener. Deceived as to the nature of this passage, he wrote on his chart &ldquo;Deception Pass,&rdquo; and the name stuck.</p><p>Today the pass is a beautiful and exotic passage for all manner of water craft as they make their way from the many marinas along the island coast to the larger waters of Puget Sound. Whether its flood tide, ebb tide, or slack tide, you can locate yourself on one of the primary viewing points of the passage and ponder the interaction of the skipper, the ship and the sea.</p><p>To reach Deception Pass by land drive west/south on Hwy 20 from I-5, or north from Oak Harbor on Whidbey Island. Coming from the south you&rsquo;ll see a sign for Deception Pass State Park. Turn left into the park and follow the signs to Little North Beach &hellip;. After you&rsquo;ve spent some time on the beach watching the currents and tide, head back out to the main road and continue north. Just across the main bridge, you&rsquo;ll encounter a parking area on the right. This is Canoe Island. From here you can walk across either bridge, or you can explore the island under the main bridge and down into the passage. Further north, on the mainland side of the bridge is another parking area with another fantastic view of the passage. </p>'
  tips: |-
    <p>1. The currents along the beach in the state park are strong and wild (tides run at speeds up to 7 miles per hour). Be careful.</p><p>2. If you&rsquo;re planning to climb around on Canoe Island, wear good shoes. There are many paths that crisscross the island, some rocky and near steep drop offs, some narrow and tangled with tree roots.

  title: Wallace Falls Hike
  seo_title: wallace-falls-hike
  sub_title: Beautiful, well-groomed trail up to a beutifull series of waterfalls
  overview: <p>Wallace Falls is set of nine different cataracts in all which are well worth the hike up.  The hike is short enough for a day time picnic outing.  But, be prepared to get a little exercise as it is a 1200 foot elevation gain up to the falls.  On the trail, you'll find many examples of Cascade regional flora and fauna as well as some old growth forest.  The trailhead is easy to find with public bathrooms and drinking water available.  The path and well marked with bridges and nicely railed vista platforms to view the falls.  There is also a covered picnic area when you reach the bottom falls.  If it weren't for the elevation gain, I would recommend this hike for all children.  However, I'd only take kids that are over 4 years old or very athletic.  A lot of people stop at the picnic area to turn around and go back.  However, if you hike the next mile, you'll get to see all of the upper falls which are quite beautiful.  The one problem with this trail is that it is very popular and you will encouter others along the way. </p>
  tips: <p>You should wear sturdy shoes although sneakers and tennis shoes should work fine.  Bring a water bottle to fill up at the trailhead as there is no drinking water available along the trail.  If you bring your dog, it must be on a leash.  This trail is definitely camera-friendly.  Don't bother with a swimsuit for the creek or falls as this is not encouraged or safe.  It's best to leave for the hike with plenty of time to get back before it is dark. </p>

  sub_title: 'A great hike because you don''t need to spend a whole day on the trail but there is still a nice lookout at the end. '
  overview: '<p>The Deep Cove Lookout hike has many names depending on which book, website or sign you are looking at: Quarry Rock Hike, Grey Rock Trail, or Indian Arm Lookout Trail.  Each is just another name for the east portion of the Baden Powel Trail that goes from deep cove to a lookout rock.  The lookout provides a great view of deep cove and Indian Arm.  Dogs are welcome on the trail without a leash and it can be hiked year round.  The lookout point can be seen from deep cove and the hike is easy compared to many on the north shore.  Due to its ease and proximity to Vancouver, the trail gets very busy on weekends.  </p><p>The hike starts off Panorama drive and there is free parking in a lot about five minute walk from the trail head.  This parking lot fills quickly on weekends and many people end up parking along Panorama drive once it is full.</p><p>From the parking lot you can find the trail head left down the sidewalk.  Look for a sign to the Baden Powel trail then follow Panorama drive and the trail head on the left hand side of the road.  The trail is well marked with many new bridges and steps so it would be difficult to get lost (but I am sure some have found a way).  The initial portion of the hike is slightly steep and all the elevation gain occurs within the first kilometer.  The second kilometer of the hike levels out while crossing multiple bridges and creeks.  The forest along the trail is typical for the north shore until arriving at the lookout.  The first lookout has a great view of deep cove and Indian arm.  For another view, continue up the trail to the left of another large rock then follow the BC Hydro pole to power line rock. </p><p>There is no loop for this trail so you need to follow the trail back to the parking lot.  There is a washroom near the parking lot and many small little shops and restaurants in nearby downtown deep cove.  I recommend replacing the calories you burn on the hike with a good ole fish n&rsquo; chips. </p>'
  tips: |-
    <p>Arrive earlier in the day to find parking before the trail gets busy
    Order a two piece fish n&rsquo; chips after the hike if your hungry</p><p>For the latest updated version of this guide please check out the Deep Cove Quarry Rock Trail  on Trekitnow.com </p>

  sub_title: 'The trail traverses two peaks before arriving at Mt Seymour Summit with a spectacular panoramic view of the area. '
  overview: <p>On a clear day this 8 km round trip trail offers hikers stunning views of the lower mainland and the surrounding mountains. The trail traverses three peaks ending at Mount Seymour Summit which offers a spectacular panoramic view of the area.  This is a great day hike for those looking for something well marked but less touristy than the Grouse Grind or Lynn Canyon Park.</p><p>The trail starts at the Mount Seymour Ski area at the last parking lot from the entrance.  Keep driving to the end where there is a map at the trail head.  During the summer parking is $3 that can be paid with a credit card or change.</p><p>At the trail head make sure to read the notices for the conditions off the trails because parts of the trail can remain snow covered into August.  From the trail head you will see a number of signs to the various trails.  The best path to start the hike forks left off the main road.  </p><p>The trail steady inclines to Brockton point revealing the first of many spectacular views of Vancouver.  The path continues upward steadily until the trail forks to Elsay Lake, make sure to follow the trail left as the Elsay Lake trail is much more challenging.  Here the path winds through the rocks to First Pump Peak and is well marked, just make sure to look for the orange markers at each turn.</p><p>Many decide to turn back after first peak but those who continue to Mount Seymour peak get a much better view of the mountains to the north.  Second pump peak is clearly visible from the first peak and the trail is easy to navigate.</p><p>The trail between the second peak and Mount Seymour Peak is the most difficult part of the hike as the trail cuts down northwest side of second peak.  If covered in snow in snow or ice it may not be possible to pass without proper equipment.</p><p>After scrambling up the southwest side of the third peak hikers are rewarded with a spectacular view of the area.  Taking some time to absorb the view then follow the same trail back to the parking lot. </p>
  tips: |-
    <p>- Allow 5 hours to complete the round trip and more time if trail has some snow cover
    - Trail is well marked with orange paint and markers but they are more difficult to see if snow is deep.
    - Hiking poles are useful for snow covered inclines
    - Much of the trail is open so sun screen is a good idea</p><p>For the latest updated version of this guide please check out the Mount Seymour Trail on Trekitnow.com </p>

  overview: <p>Geologists say the Vashon Glacial Ice Sheet, which also formed Puget Sound and other area lakes, formed Green Lake 50,000 years ago. Dredgings of Green Lake have produced volcanic ash from an eruption of Glacier Peak that occurred about 6,700 years ago.</p><p>The lake was included in the Olmsted Brothers&rsquo; comprehensive parks plan, and was given to the City by the State of Washington in 1905. Green Lake underwent a series of changes over the next 15 years- it was diked, dredged and filled until it shrunk by nearly 100 acres! The last fill deposited in Green Lake was from the excavation of Aurora Avenue.</p><p>In more recent times, Green Lake has suffered from stagnation and pollution problems, as well as algae blooms. Milfoil and swimmers itch (caused by parasites from waterfowl) are still a consideration for those who swim in the lake.</p><p> </p>

  overview: <p>This challenging day trail offers a variety of attractions and terrain types, from the touristy Lynn Canyon Suspension bridge and top of Grouse Mountain to the back country Hanes Valley route.  This is a perfect hike for visitors to Vancouver who are interested in catching the &ldquo;regular tourist sights&rdquo; but also want to experience the natural beauty of Vancouver&rsquo;s nearby mountains without crowds of fellow tourists.</p><p>The Hanes Valley trail is a one way 15 km (9 mile) hike between Lynn Valley and the top of Grouse Mountain.  The hike can be done both ways but this guide describes starting a Lynn Valley which is the uphill route.  Experienced hikers should allow 8 hours for this hike but less experienced hikers should allow for more time.  The trail is best done in late season because it traverses creek crossings and alpine slopes that are snow covered most of the year, so be sure to check trail conditions on the trail head boards before heading out.  </p><p>Although there is a quicker way to get to the trail head via Lynn Valley road this guide suggests taking the Varley trail to the trail head via Lynn canyon park.  Since this is a one way trail it is best to take public transit to and from the trail head.  </p><p>Take the 228 to Lynn Valley and get off at the Peters Road exit.   Buses leave from Londsdale Quay every 15 minutes during peak hours and every 30 early in the morning and late evening,   At Peters Road follow the signs to Lynn Canyon Park.  </p><p>At Lynn Canyon park take some quick snapshots of the suspension bridge while crossing over.  After the bridge turn left and follow the trail along Lynn Creek, until another less impressive bridge.  Cross the bridge to find the trail head for the Varley trail which takes you along the West side of Lynn creek to the Lynn Valley headwaters regional office and the trail head.</p><p>After arriving at the regional office take the bridge across the creek to the the hiker information and registration board.  From the trail head follow the Lynn Loop trail for 1.8 km to the Cedars mill / headwaters trail junction.  After this junction the trail narrows and is marked with yellow markers until the bottom of the scree slope below the crown pass.  </p><p>The hiker can choose either the Cedars Mill trail which follows the historic road to the site of Cedar Mill or the slightly more challenging Headwaters trail which is only 200 M (650 ft) longer.  This guide follows the cedar mill trail but both trails arrive at 3rd debris chute.</p><p>After the 3rd debris chute the trail inclines away from Lynn creek until arriving at the turn off for Coliseum mountain.  Fewer tourists pass the third debris chute so the trail is more natural and it is common to see bear droppings and deer (as we did while researching this guide) along the trail .  </p><p>A five minute walk after the trail fork for Coliseum mountain is a metal suspension bridge and a trail to Norvan falls.  Norvan falls is about a ten minute walk and offers good photo opportunities and a place snack before continuing down the trail.  After viewing the falls backtrack to the bridge then continue down the trail on the other side of Norvan creek.</p><p>After crossing the bridge the trail winds through Hanes Valley where it is easy to image the forest before loggers arrived in the early 1900s because many of the old growth tree stumps are visible.  Continue until reaching the junction for the Lynn Lake trail and turn left down to a natural creek crossing.  The trail then ascends over small creeks and small avalanche tracks to a helicopter landing site at the bottom of the steep rock scree that goes up 490 m (1600 ft) to the crown pass.</p><p>After a long steep climb on boulders and loose rocks is the crown pass, here follow the trail left towards goat mountain.  The trail continues to be challenging but chains have been added in steep areas assist hikers.  Follow the signs to Grouse mountain unless you have enough energy and time for a short trek to the goat mountain peak to enjoy the view of the mountains (not included in this guide).</p><p>The trail markers end at the hiker information board which is where the trail starts from the Grouse mountain end.  Follow the road down the hill to the Grouse mountain lodge where you can enjoy dinner with a view of the entire city of Vancouver.</p><p>The Grouse Skyride can be taken down the mountain for $10 (they recently raised the price from $5) or it is possible to walk down via the Grouse Grind trail.  At the bottom of Grouse Mountain take the 236 bus to Londsdale Quay then the 228 bus back to Lynn Canyon park if the vehicle was left there. </p>
  tips: |-
    <p>- Bears also use this trail so bring bear bells and bear spray
    - Black flies and mosquitoes can be a problem so bug spray is a must
    - Save you knees and bring $20 or a credit card to buy a ticket to take the Skyride down Grouse mountain
    - Bring exact change for the bus, $2.50
    - Park your car at Londsdale Quay and take the buses from there, this shortens the return trip back to the car after the hike.
    - Make sure to check for the latest bus routes and times
    - The Lynn Canyon parking lot closes at 9:00 pm</p><p>For the latest updated version of this guide please check out the Hanes Valley Hike on Trekitnow.com </p>

  overview: <p>A Vancouver local once explained to me why he had originally come to the city for a two-week holiday but had never gone home.</p><p>&quot;In that two weeks, I went hiking, sailing and skiing without ever leaving the city limits.&quot;</p><p>That would be a lot to pack into a one-day trail, but this guide gives the user a taste of some of the natural gems that so excite local lovers of the great outdoors. The city is built around a spectacular harbour that is itself surrounded by forested and often snow-clad mountains. A few minutes walk from its 'Downtown' centre is North America's largest urban park, which caters for all with paved cycling paths and rougher wilderness tracks.</p><p>This trail is designed so that you can do it in either direction and end up somewhere with a water view where you can experience Vancouver's highly-rated foodie credentials and underrated BC wines.</p><p>I'm opting to start at the Granville Island end, stocking up with lunch supplies from its extensive food market, before wandering past the boats moored along False Creek to take in the city skyline.  Then, hopping aboard one of the comical 'bathtub' ferries, we backtrack a mile by water to join the seawall path that skirts Stanley Park. Along the way, the trail will delve inland to see the park's natural and man-made wonders before finishing at picturesque Coal Harbour where you can watch float planes take off towards the mountains. </p>
  tips: <p>The Stanley Park Ecology Society (see link in 'other resources') has an office at the southern end of Lost Lagoon, and they are a wealth of knowledge if you want to learn about park flora &amp; fauna in more detail. The natural features of the park will obviously change with the seasons and they will be able to advise how to adapt the route of this guide through the park to take advantage of particular highlights for the time of your visit. </p>

Summer weekends see a steady stream of people &ldquo;Doin the Grind&rdquo; from when the trail opens till closing.  With an approximate 56 per cent slope (30&deg;) and very few flat parts this hike is often refereed to as Nature&rsquo;s StairMaster.  Most view the Grind as a workout as there are no viewpoints along the route and it consists of mainly stairs, thus it is primary completed for exercise.  However, many tourists to Vancouver also feel obligated to make the climb if for nothing more than to say they did it and complain about the hike being to steep and crowded (which are both valid complaints).  </p><p>The trail head is at the base of Grouse mountain and is found at the end of Capilano road in North Vancouver.  There is ample parking near the trail head and buses run all the way to the hikes starting point (if using Google maps find directions to Grouse Mountain Skyride).  To find the trail, look for the Grouse Grind sign just east of the Skyride (If coming up Capilano road the trail head is just left of the Gondola complex).  Look for the notice board, clock and water vending machine then go through the gate which locks when it gets to late to start, normally around 7:00 in the summer.</p><p>Once through the gate, follow the trail over a small bridge then start ascending the mountain.  You will come to a trail fork for the Baden Powell Trail, go left at the fork and continue up the mountain.  If you are looking for a less busy and slightly less strenuous trail to the top of the mountain then follow the fork right and take the BCMC trail up the mountain. </p><p>The Grind is a well marked and developed trail.  The hike is fairly uneventful apart from the quarterly markers measuring your progress.  Each section is a constant uphill ascent of stairs both natural and man made but the third and fourth quarter are the steepest with some very steep portions.  </p><p>Most will reach the peak&rsquo;s plateau in around 1.5 hours with Vancouver elite &ldquo;Grinders&rdquo; completing the trail in half an hour.  Once at the top, snacks, drinks and even burgers are available for purchase at the Peak Chalet.  </p><p>There are also a number of tourist attractions at the top of the mountain including:\n- Wildlife Refuge with two grizzly bears\n- Lumberjack shows\n- Eye of the wind \n- Animal wood carvings\n- Mountain zip lines</p><p>The tourist information center in the chalet has more information on these and other activities. The top of Grouse mountain is also the start of many other hikes into the Lynn Valley Headwaters park including the Hanes Valley Hike.</p><p>After checking out the sights and resting at the top of the mountain it is time to head back down.  You can save your knees by paying $10 for the Gondola ride down.  Hiking down the Grouse Grind trail is prohibited so for those interested in hiking down the best options is to follow the British Columbia Mountaineering Club (BCMC) trail down the mountain which is included in this track.</p><p>The BCMC trail starts to the right of where the Grouse Grind arrives at the mountain and is marked clearly with a red warning sign.  This hike runs parallel to the Grouse Grind but is slightly less steep but longer.  It is clearly marked with orange markers and meets up with the Grind near the bottom of the trail.</p><p>Although this may not be the best or most interesting hike Vancouver&rsquo;s North Shore has to offer, the Grind should be on each Vancouver tourists to do list and is a great workout for those who prefer a natural StairMaster to the gym. </p>"
  tips: |-
    <p>- Bring lots of water
    - Start early or on weekdays to avoid the crowds
    - Take the Skyride down the mountain to save your knees</p><p>For the latest updated version of this guide please check out the The Grouse Grind on Trekitnow.com </p>

  title: Coal Creek Trail
  seo_title: coal-creek-trail
  sub_title: A short hike through the woods while exploring the area's coal mining history.
  overview: <p>This is an easy hike that will lead you through a historical coal mining region. While the towns are gone you will still be able to view some artifacts from the past. Along the way you will see a coal mine shaft and an information kiosk where you can learn more about its history. There are also a few railroad cart turntables but they are difficult to spot as their concrete foundations are all that is left and the forest has now grown over them. During your hike you will also catch the smell of coal and burnt cinders from time to time.</p><p>Most of the trail is packed dirt but there are a few hills that can be slippery especially after it rains.  I would suggest wearing hiking boots or a good pair of trail running shoes. This trail has recently received some attention in the form of new bridges. As of August 2010 the park service has been busy replacing many of the bridges in the park. The new structures are larger and sturdier than the ones being replaced. One bridge in particular was an adventure to cross and may have been a deterrent to some, but now all river and stream crossings are possible.</p><p>If you start your journey from the Red Town parking lot, you will quickly come across an old coal mine shaft. It has been sealed but when standing next to it you can still smell the coal from below. Next to the mine is an information kiosk that will provide you with a little history of the area. It is interesting to read about the towns that were here and try to imagine what life would have been like while traversing the trail of today. On the kiosk you will see a few photos of the miners and their mining village. A little further down you will come to the North Fork Falls along with a few benches to sit and enjoy the waterfall. The falls are not large and it is best to visit them after a few days of heavy rain. From here you will walk through the forest and onto a short section of the trail composed of gravel. The trail is mostly a gentle down hill hike where you will make a few stream crossings on the newly renovated bridges. Soon you will find yourself in a clearing with many black berry bushes, watch out for the thorns as the trail is overgrown at times. Once you make your way back into the shaded forest the trail begins its steep decline. At first you will be hiking down a small ridge but it will begin getting steeper and muddier from here.  For this next section you may need to take advantage of the trees and their roots to guide yourself down, especially if the trail is wet. Once at the bottom the trail will level out and you will come to the last two bridges. Once you cross the first bridge you will come to the Forest Drive trailhead. Continue straight to cross another bridge and a short distance later you will see a small retention pond along with the fish ladders at the end of the trail.</p><p>At a distance of 2.8 miles, 5.6 miles out and back, this hike will provide you and your family with a great short outing along with some history. However if you are looking for a longer hike there are 2 connecting trails, Primrose Trail (.8 miles) and the Forest Drive Trail (about 4 miles out and back depending on route), which can make this a full day hike. </p>
  tips: "<p>How to get here: \nFrom I-90 East take Exit 13 and make a right at the stop sign. Continue to follow Lakemont Blvd SE and the Red Town Trailhead parking lot will be on the left, about 3 miles away. This is also the Cougar Mountain parking area. The Coal Creek trail is just across the street from the parking area. Use caution when crossing the street as there is no cross walks.</p><p>From Interstate 405, take the Coal Creek Parkway exit which leads you to the city of Newcastle; turn left on Southeast 72nd Street and then another left onto Newcastle-Coal Creek Road. There will be a small dirt parking area about 1.8 miles from the exit. </p><p>Park Hours: \nThe park is open year around from 8:00AM to Dusk </p>"

  title: Coal Creek Natural Area
  seo_title: coal-creek-natural-area
  sub_title: Look closely to discover pieces from the areas coal mining history along these three trails.
  overview: <p>The Coal Creek Natural Area has three wonderful trails to hike, the Coal Creek, Primrose, and Lower Coal Creek Trail.  All trails will lead you up and down small ravines, through a forest of Douglas Firs, and along the Coal Creek. Along the way you will catch glimpses from the past as there are still many artifacts left over from the areas mining days. In some spots you can still catch the scent of burnt cinders while hiking down the trail.</p><p>The Coal Creek Trail is the most frequently hiked trails in the park. Its popularity comes from the variety of attractions all on a relatively short day hike. Nearly all of the best coal mining attractions are found along this trail, from the sealed mineshaft to the concrete foundations of buildings long gone. This trail has recently received many new bridges. That adds to the ease and beauty of the hike.</p><p>The Primrose Trail is a short loop off of the Coal Creek Trail. This trail offers a great hike along the creek where you will see a few of the mining artifacts left behind. Unfortunately the trail has been closed due to a portion of the trail being washed out. Hopefully with the renovations to the Coal Creek Trail, this trail will also see some work done on it.</p><p>Finally, the Lower Coal Creek Trail is one of my favorite trails in the area. The trail is used infrequently so you will often have this trail to yourself. The lack of hikers is because it is not a well known trail and to the popularity of the nearby Cougar Mountain Trails. However, this is a hidden gem that leads you along portions of Coal Creek. If you have just one hike to pick out of the three trails, I would suggest this one. </p>

  title: Primrose Trail
  seo_title: primrose-trail
  sub_title: 'Part of the Coal Creek Park trail system, this trail will take you along a creek with a few small waterfalls. '
  overview: |-
    <p>At only .8 miles the Primrose Trail seems like a quick detour, however, this trail offers some of the best sites to be seen. On this trail you will follow Coal Creek while making a few crossings of the creek via wooden bridges. Along the way you will also pass by Sand Stone Falls, one of Coal Creeks tributaries.</p><p>The Primrose Trail is named after a coal seam that was mined in the 1800's. While nature has covered up almost all traces of the mining activities there are a few artifacts that can be spotted along the trail.</p><p>I started my hike from the West Primrose trail marker.  The first thing that you will notice is that the trail marker is accompanied by a blue closed sign. I did not take notice of this sign as it was to the far right of the trail entrance. In fact I did not know this trail was even closed until I started making this guide and began to photograph my return trip. After researching the trail further I found out that the Primrose trail has been closed for a few years now due to the trail being washed out. While the trail is a bit rough in places, I found the trail to be easy to navigate. Along the way I found out that I was not alone, several other hikers were on the Primrose Trail with me. At that time I did not think to ask them about the trail closure since I was unaware of the closure.  I believe that many people still use this trail, you can tell by the worn trail and somebody has written &quot;just be careful&quot; on the East trail marker closed sign. With that being said the trail is &quot;closed&quot; but I will describe my hike on the Primrose Trail.</p><p>The trail starts out on a slight decline with the trail consisting of hard packed dirt. I came across some blackberry bushes and began to hear the sound of Coal Creek flowing just ahead. When I approached the creek the trail became narrower and I could see a small drop off where part of the trail has eroded away. The trail widens up a bit and again I was walking among ferns and blackberry bushes. For the next few tenths of a mile I followed the creek almost never losing site of it until I came upon Sand Stone Falls. While the falls are not as impressive when compared to the larger Coal Creek Falls, I always enjoy water features on a trail. The falls appear to come from a large black pipe at the top. The water gently trickles down the rocks incline rather than the typical crashing that you would see from other waterfalls. Once past the falls I came across a wooden bridge which crosses over the creek.  The bridge did not look sturdy and a laminated &quot;walk&quot; sign was posted on it. I was to close to the end of the trail to turn back now and decided to press on. Every step that I took on the bridge caused it to shake. I tested each plank before I committed my full weight and continued slowly to the other side. Once on the other side I noticed that many of the screws that were holding the bridge together have now come loose. I&rsquo;m just glad it held together for my crossing. With the bridge behind me the trail began to climb slightly uphill. On one of the first sets of switchbacks I came across another mining artifact, a pair of coal car axles. Past the axles the trail gets muddier and steeper, however this only lasts about .3 miles as I made my way back to the Coal Creek Trail.</p><p>This is a great trail with many sites to see while hiking along Coal Creek. I hope that with the current work being done to the Coal Creek Trail, this trail receives some attention and can be reopened soon.

  title: Lower Coal Creek Trail
  seo_title: lower-coal-creek-trail
  sub_title: Nature hike with multiple Coal Creek crossings.
  overview: |-
    <p>This trail is an excellent finish to the four trails of Coal Creek Park. This trail offers the best views of Coal Creek and offers more of a challenge. The hills are not terribly steep but there are many and opportunity to rest is few.</p><p>Starting out from the parking lot on SE 60th you will descend into the forest on a set of wooden stairs. The trail will continue downhill for a bit making for an easy trip down to Coal Creek. On your way down you will come across a few switchbacks that will help ease this down hill portion. Shortly, you will come to an opening in the forest, as you pass through you will hear the hum of the power lines above. Moving back into the forest you will be close to reaching Coal Creek. There are a few downed trees on this section of the trail, careful when jumping over as the trail begins to get muddy. You should now begin to hear the sound of Coal Creek. You will catch a quick glimpse of the creek as you come to a fork in the trail. Taking the fork to the right is a large bridge that crosses over the creek.  I think this is one of the best spots to photograph the creek. If you have hiked the other trails in the park you can agree that this is the largest portion of Coal Creek yet. Continue up the trail and it will lead you out onto Coal Creek Parkway. It is a busy road that will lead you to no other trails. I suggest forgoing the rest of the trail and returning to the fork from hence you came. Moving North on the trail you will see a sign explaining that improvements are being made to the trail ahead. The trail will narrow and is less maintained, if it is wet out and you do not have a pair of shoes with good grip, I would suggest turning back now. At first the trail is muddier and along the way you will come across several bridges. Most of the bridges are at some stage of repair or replacement; see my photos to check out the bridge conditions and warnings. One short bridge in particular is about ready to collapse, lucky it is easy to walk around if careful. Nearing the end of the trail you will again reach a few switchbacks, this area is extremely slick. It appears to be compacted clay and even walking very slowly I noticed I was sliding down the hill. If you have made it this far you are almost at the end. Crossing another newly constructed bridge, you will come to another fork in the trail. Follow the signs, just .2 miles to the end where you will be rewarded with a great view of Coal Creek. Here you will see the two sections of the creek join into a small pond that disappears into a concrete storm drain.</p><p>This trail is just over 4 miles out and back. I think it provides the best views of Coal Creek and will be the best hike in Coal Creek Park when all improvements have been completed.

  title: Wildside Trail
  seo_title: wildside-trail
  sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.
  overview: <p>This is one of my favorite trails to run on within the Cougar Mountain Park. It has a lot to offer in the form of scenery, access to other trails, and challenge. This trail can also be difficult to navigate if this is your first time hiking the trail. The first half of the trail seems to end with you having to walk 30 feet in either direction to locate the next trailhead marker. However if you are following the GPS route in this guide you should not have any problems.</p><p>Heading out from the parking area you will come to a trailhead marker for Red Town Trail and Wildside Trail. Take the path to the right to begin down the trail. The trail starts off wide and well maintained, however once you arrive at the first bridge the trail can get muddy. Once you cross over the stream you should see a short set of wooden stairs leading up. At the top of the stairs is the junction point for 3 different trails. Head to your left and continue on for 30-40 feet and you should see the trailhead marker to continue on the Wildside Trail. This is where the trail gets muddy; I would suggest having an extra pair of shoes to change into to keep your car clean. Once over the two small bridges you should not have any problems navigating the trail. In about .4 miles you should come to another trailhead marker for Marshall's Hill Trail. Continue straight and the end of the trail will be .3 away from the last junction. This last section can be really muddy; I have had mud come up past my high top boots on a few occasions. When you come to an area with two railroad ties sticking out of the ground you will be near the end of the trail. At the end of the trail you can make a left and take a look at the retention pond, but I would advise against this if you are hiking in the summer time as there will be mosquitoes.</p><p>The Wildside Trail offers the quickest routes to the Bagley Seam Trail, Rainbow Town Trail, and Steam Hoist Trail. I would suggest taking this trail if you are trying to see all of the mining exhibits in one day. While it is not a difficult trail it does offer more of a challenge than other hikes on the West side of the mountain. </p>

  sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.
  overview: <p>The official trail may only be .2 miles long but to get to this trail you will have to hike in using one of two different routes, via Red Town Trail or Wildside Trail. The total distance travelled round trip will be about 3/4 of a mile from the Red Town parking area.</p><p>This trail is a nice part of the coal mining history that can be found at Cougar Mountain. On this trail you can see and touch an actual coal vein, better known as Bagley Seam for which the trail is named after.  From either direction you come from you will come across the seam near the half way point in the trail. It can be difficult to spot if you are hiking this trail in the fall when large maple leaves cover the ground.  To help guide you, there is a large fallen tree on the trail and you will have to step over its stump to continue on the trail. This stump serves as a marker for the Bagley Seam.  Look to the other side of the stump, about 1 foot above the trail, and you will see the black coal protruding from the rock.</p><p>This is the only attraction to see on this short trail but it does tie in with the mining history of the area. If you are hiking these trails to learn more about the areas coal mining history I would suggest hiking this trail in addition with; Rainbow Town Trail, Steam Hoist Trail, Red Creek Trail, and the Coal Creek Trails.  Together these trails will provide you with a relatively easy hike that can be completed by nearly everyone.</p><p>If you are looking for a challenging trail run this short trail would be a great trail to start on. It is short but technical as there are many slippery rocks and stumps to traverse.  The incline of the trail is also steep and will offer a challenge to beginner trail runners. </p>

On this trail you will see many artifacts from the mining days of the area and information on the mining activities.</p><p>The best way to get to the Rainbow Town Trail is to hike in from the Wildside Trail. From the Red Town parking area take the Wildside Trail and in .1 miles you will see the trailhead marker for Rainbow Town.  The trail is fairly level to get here but you will have to cross two small creeks for which bridges have been built. For this section of the park, I would advise you bringing an extra pair of shoes if it has been raining since this trail has a few spots that can have deep muddy puddles.</p><p>On the trail you can see a mining cart full with coal from the mines below.

  overview: <p>This hike will take you past lower 150 foot Coopey Falls, Upper Coopey Falls which you can walk below, and up many switchbacks to a beautiful view over the Columbia River below.  There is also a really cool ridge of lava rock at the top that you can walk along for different views back towards the Angel's Rest Viewpoint.  This can be done any season but be warned that the trail can become very icy in the winter. </p>
  tips: |-

  sub_title: 'This 4,000 foot peak with its rocky summit spire will provide you great views of Portland, Hood and the Columbia Gorge '
  overview: '<p>This loop hike will start you off at the top of Larch Mountain at Sherrard Point just over 4,000 feet with fantastic views of 4 major Cascade Volcanoes!  Sherrard Point is an easy walk from the parking lot at the top of Larch Mountain Road.  This road is definitely not open in the winter so plan accordingly.  From here you will then take a loop hike around the crater of Larch Mountain down to Multnomah Creek and up to its headwaters which ultimately feed the famous Multnomah Falls in the Columbia Gorge.  Then you will traverse across the bottom of the crater to the Oneonta Trail which will bring you back to the parking lot.  </p><p>Note:  There are picnic areas near the top if you want to leave the family there while you go on this hike with the adventurous family members :) </p>'
  tips: |-
    <p>Directions to Larch Mountain Highway:
    The highway is located off the Gorge Scenic Highway about 0.8 miles southwest of Crown Point near milepost 10.6.  It is a paved road to the summit.  It is open late May until the snow begins to fall.  There is no fee to park at the top.</p><p> </p>

  title: Wilderness Cliffs Trail
  seo_title: wilderness-cliffs-trail
  sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park
  overview: <p>This trail can be accessed from two different routes. The quickest route is to hike up the Squak Mountain Connector Trail from the base of the mountain and continue up onto this trail. This is also the most direct route to reach the peak.</p><p>The hike up to the peak on this section of the trail can be difficult when compared to other trails located within the park. To aid in your ascent of Wilderness peak, you will find many switchbacks. Luckily most of the trail is shaded by the thick canopy of trees, making the trail a little cooler. Overall this trail will provide a small you with a small challenge. It is a good warm up hike early in the season before taking on those longer and steeper hikes. </p>

  overview: <p>This is the highest point within the Cougar Mountain Park. To get here you can take either the Wilderness Creek Trail or the Wilderness Cliffs Trail. The hike up to this point can be a challenge where you will encounter a steep climb and at times, rocky terrain. The final stretch to the peak is a gentle short climb where you can rest and relax. </p><p>On your way up towards the peak you will be surrounded by giant ferns. The trail is shady, provided by the large Douglas fir trees over head. After your short hike down this trail you will come to a small clearing and a large wooden bench. The peak on this mountain does not afford you a view as the top is covered in a dense forest. Take a seat on the giant wooden chair and relax, reflect on your accomplishment of making it to the peak. Before heading back down the mountain take a minute to sign the log book located across from the wooden chair, showing that you made it to the top. </p>

  sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.
  overview: <p>The Long View Peak Trail is a short trail that begins at the peak of the Wilderness Creek Trail. It is a very short trail that will lead you towards the Doughty Falls found a short distance away on the Deceiver Trail. </p><p>Most of the elevation gain is behind you now. There is little elevation gain or loss on this trail despite the fact that you will be hiking over a peak. Once at the top of the peak you will find a horse hitch, if you rode up, and will be surrounded by large Douglas fir trees. There is not much of a view, contrary to the name of the peak, but there are a few breaks in the foliage where you can see the vast forest of the western portion of Cougar Mountain.</p><p>I would suggest continuing on if you have made it this far to catch a glimpse of Doughty Falls. If you are looking for a full days hike, it is possible to hike down Deceiver Trail then onto Shy Bear Pass to make a large loop and see some great sites. </p>

  overview: <p>This short loop is another trail at Cougar Mountain where you can see some of the areas coal mining history.  Along this trail you will come across the concrete pillars from the mines steam hoist. A steam hoist is basically a crane that used steam power to raise and lower objects into and out of the mine.  </p><p>The quickest way to get to this trail is from hiking the Wildside Trail. Once you reach the Rainbow Town Trail intersection you have the option to continue on the Wildside Trail onto Steam Hoist Trail. You can also connect to the trail by making a left at the intersection on Rainbow Town Trail followed by a quick right onto Steam Hoist. This area can get confusing as there are many short trails that meet in this area. Follow the other trail guides to make sure you are on the correct trail or remember to pick up a paper trail map at the Red Town parking area.</p><p>If you are hiking these trails to learn more about the areas coal mining history I would suggest hiking this trail in addition with; Rainbow Town Trail, Red Creek Trail, Bagley Seam Trail, and the Coal Creek Trails.  Together these trails will provide you with a relatively easy hike that can be completed by nearly everyone. </p>

  overview: <p>This short trail is located in between the Wilderness Peak and Longview Peak. You will hike down a gentle trail through a ravine leading out of the Cougar Mountain Park. The trail is short but does offer some great views of open forested spaces. This trail can also be used by horseback riders; the trail is narrow in spots so use caution if you have to pass by a rider. This trail can also be a great way to warm up on. With most of the connecting trails containing a thick forest canopy, this can be a welcome sight to take a minute to warm up in the suns rays.</p><p>If you live nearby you can access this trail from the 182nd Ave cul-de-sac. Curbside parking is available if you are looking for a quick route up to the top of Wilderness Peak. However, I would not suggest curbside parking if you plan on horseback riding as the space is limited. </p>

  sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.
  overview: <p>Often when hiking on this trail I find myself alone. Not because the trail is not worth hiking but because it is not well known. If you are hiking on the Southside of Cougar Mountain many hikers opt to start out from the paved parking area located a few hundred feet west, to make their trek to the mountain peak via the Wilderness Creek Trail. You can access this trail from the main parking area; however, there is a small dirt pull out conveniently located at the trailhead that will provide direct access.</p><p>Hiking up from this trail provides the shortest route up the mountain to reach the summit. It also allows you to choose the Wilderness Creek Trail on your return trip allowing you to make a loop without having to hike the same trail on your decent.</p><p>The dirt pullout is also a great parking area if you are looking to hike both Cougar Mountain and Squak Mountain. The West Access Trail on Squak Mountain can be accessed by a small trail entrance across the road. It can be difficult to spot as the entrance does not appear to be maintained. Standing in the dirt pullout area you should see a large dirt clearing directly across the street, the trail entrance is located to the left of the business property. </p>

  title: Wilderness Creek Trail
  seo_title: wilderness-creek-trail
  sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.
  overview: <p>This is one of the most scenic trails on the south side of Cougar Mountain. It is also one of the steeper sections of the park, which from the parking area quickly gains 1000 ft. in elevation. There are a few breaks in the elevation gain towards the middle of the trail where you will pass through Shy Bear Marsh. Along the way there are a few creek crossings and some wooden bridges to aid in your crossings. At times there will be a few breaks in the forest where you can glimpse out over the top of the lower elevation trees and see the surrounding mountains.</p><p>If you are not in a hurry I would suggest taking this trail in route to the Wilderness Peak. It will only take you an extra 20-30 minutes but the views on this trail surpass the other routes up the mountain. Once you reach the end of the trail you will join up with the Wilderness Peak Trail, which takes you up a 1/2 mile trail to the peak. On your way back down you can either return the way you came up or take the Wilderness Cliffs Trail. This forms a nice loop that will connect back with the Wilderness Creek Trail midway down the mountain. Overall I think that this is one of my favorite trails to hike on for the views and a great trail run if you are looking for a challenging uphill run. </p>

  overview: <p>The Deceiver Trail is a great hike located in the southern portion of Cougar Mountain. While this trail is an easy hike, getting here will be a bit of a challenge .To get here you will have to make your way up the Wilderness Peak Trail and over the Long View Peak. </p><p>This trail starts at the top of Long View Peak; make your way down the trail towards the sound of rushing water. At the halfway point of the trail you will come to a fork in the trail. If you take the trail to the left you will come to Doughty Falls. On most days in the summer and fall, the waterfall is barely a trickle down some large moss covered rocks. If you wish to see the falls at their best plan a hike during the spring time after a few days of heavy rain.</p><p>Hiking back up to where the trail forks, you can now continue left to complete the Deceiver Trail. The rest of the trail takes you deeper into the forest as you make your way 1/2 mile to the end where the trail will meet up with Shy Bear Pass. If you have made it to the end you have the option to turn around and repeat the Deceiver Trail or you can make a right down Shy Bear Pass. Making a right on Shy Bear Pass will lead you in a large loop back towards the Wilderness Creek Trail from which you can head down the mountain towards the parking area. </p>

  sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.
  overview: <p>The Red Town Trail is one of the first trails you will come across when entering the park. From the information kiosk walk forward and keep left at the trailhead marker. The trail is very wide when compared to its connecting trails, but it is composed of a mixture of large and small rocks.</p><p>The trail is named after a mining town by the same name that existed in the late 1800's. The houses were mainly red, hence the name, and served as a railroad depot where coal was carted from the nearby mines to Lake Washington. Other than the houses there was a large hotel in the town which you can still see the boiler rooms foundation.</p><p>The trail is fairly easy to navigate, it is wide and other than a few bends in the road is fairly straight and level. There is some elevation gain to the trail as you leave the parking lot but it shouldn't be an issue as I have seen off road baby strollers being used on the trail numerous times. The only thing I would suggest looking out for are the larger rocks where you can roll your ankle. As you walk up the trail you will be surrounded on both sides by large Douglas Firs. On the first half of the trail you will encounter many people, especially on sunny days, as the trail is the main route to many of the parks waterfalls. If you stay on the trail you will begin to see fewer people but that's not to say that there is nothing to see. If you are hiking in the Spring or Summer you can view some amazing wild flowers towards the end of the trail. After a few twists and turns you will come to a horse watering hole (this is closed in the winter due to freezing). To the right you will see a sign for the meadow restoration project. Following the path, you will shortly come to a gated area and a bench to rest your feet. There are several informational signs in the area that describe the local flora in the meadow. Now that you know what you are looking at enter one of the two gates and explore the short loop of wild flowers. Once done you can return to the trail from the route you took or cross a bridge just North of the meadow which will connect you to the Indian Trail.</p><p>This is the most frequently used trails on the west side of the park because of how many trails it connects to. Most people hike the Red Town Trail to access the Coal Creek Falls Trail where they can view the popular Coal Creek Falls. </p>

The trail is a short .3 mile trail on a wide, gravel, park service road. </p><p>Once you get past the service gate you will begin walking South on the gravel road. The trail starts out fairly flat, on your left you will see a grass clearing. There are no picnic tables here but the space is large enough to have lunch if you brought a blanket or some chairs with you. Continuing on the road you will come to a fork in the road, to the right is the service road entrance, to the left the trail continues. A wooden trail marker will be located at the intersection just to the left. Shortly after turning left you will come to another service gate, pass through over the logs on your left. The trail begins to gain in elevation but only slightly. You will also become surrounded by the forest as you get deeper into the park. A few feet away from the service gate you can see another trail head marker; this one will lead you to the Rainbow Town Trail. Continuing straight on the China Creek Trail you will notice that the trail narrows slightly and becomes slightly steeper. At the end of the trail you will come to a clearing and find yourself at the end of a neighborhood block. This is the end of the China Creek Trail, you can now walk back to explore other trails within the park or retrace your steps back to the parking area.</p><p>This trail is not the most scenic trail you will come across, not even close.

  sub_title: Go for the desert waterfalls and incredible views.  Perfect hiking in the winter!!!
  overview: <p>Great winter hiking, if you don't mind snakes, its worth it in the summer (but could get really hot).  Stunning photography of mesas, arroyos and waterfalls.  Easy to adjust the hike to the distance you want.  Be a great family hike. </p><p>&bull; Wonderful story about this being a sheep ranch.  You can imagine people living out here in the old days. </p>
  tips: <p>If you are viewing this on the phone App - go online for web links to park resources, trail video, and 360&ordm; panorama interactive photos - www.everytrail.com</p><p>&bull; In the summer - bring lots of water, double what you think you will consume.  By and large, people underestimate their water needs, especially in the desert. </p><p>&bull; I don't want to scare people way, but there are rattle snakes out here.  We came across three in late April.  If you stick to the main road/trail, you can easily spot them if they are crossing the road - we only saw one crossing.  Just beware, lots of people think there are no rattle snakes in northeastern Washington, which is not true.  Also, this area is heavy with ticks in tick season - April through June is the hight of the season. </p><p>&bull; This area does not have any hiking fees.</p><p>&bull; Dogs must be under the owners control.  During the worse of the tick season, leave them home.  With the snakes, leash them late March to early October. </p>

  seo_title: indian-trail
  sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.
  overview: <p>The Indian Trail has a lot to offer on a short hike. There are several other trails that branch off from this trail which can provide numerous short hikes or for a full day of site seeing. To access the Indian Trail you can hike down the Red Town Trail from the main parking area or from the 171st street cul-de-sac. If you are not looking for a full day hike and are looking for a quick 1-2 hour hike, parking off of the 171st street is your best bet. From the cul-de-sac you can reach the Far County Falls in 20 minutes.</p><p>The Far County Falls are the main attraction on this trail. The size of the falls changes greatly depending on how much it has rained in the previous week. In the summer time the falls can be just a trickle of water, barely enough to moisten the mossy rocks. The best time to see the falls are in late winter to spring time. They are a great site to see as few people make the journey down to the falls due to how much they can vary. </p>
  tips: |-
    <p>How to get here: </p><p>From I-90 East take Exit 13 and make a right at the stop sign. Continue to follow Lakemont Blvd SE and the Red Town Trailhead parking lot will be on the left, about 3 miles away. The parking area holds 25-30 cars and has additional parking is to the left of the entrance. </p><p>To access the Indian Trail is to start down Red Town Trail and connect to Indian Trail .8 miles down the trail.</p><p>The most scenic route is to take the Wildside Trail. From here you will get a chance to see a few of the mining sites along the way.  At the Wildside Trail and Marshall's Hill crossroad make a left at the trail marker, towards Indian Trail. The Indian Trail marker will be on the right.</p><p>The quickest route to the trail is from the 171st cul-de-sac. From I-405 south, take exit 10, Coal Creek Parkway SE and head east. You will stay on this road for awhile until you come to SE May valley road, make a left and continue for 3.5 miles, make a left of 112th street. Continue down 112th and it will become 169th street. Finally take the left up a steep hill onto 171st. You can park anywhere along the side of the road. The trail will be at the end of the cul-de sac.</p><p>Connecting Trails:</p><p>-Red Town Trail

Count on 3 1/2 to 4 hours. \n- Hiking the loop clockwise (opposite the direction of this guide), you reach the Cedar Grove with a warning sign that the trail is &quot;primitive&quot; beyond that point.  Keep on going, it is a disclaimer sign geared toward the casual day walker/hiker.  The trail is a regular hiking trail beyond that point.  Its not suitable for people out for a stroll in the park, but perfect for hikers.\n- If going early in the spring or late in the fall, when there is a chance of snow in the waterfall area, hike the loop clockwise (opposite the direction of this guide).  The trail up to the waterfalls is steep, so in snow/ice conditions, it is better to be going uphill.  Also, Diamond spikes or similar traction device for boots is recommended - along with a trekking pole.  In snow/ice pack, continue to go up, the probability of injury increases exponentially trying to hike down steep ice covered inclines. </p>"

Bring extra water, its a trail where you will consume more water than you expect. </p><p>&bull; Dogs: it is a leashed dog trail, but on the &quot;extra&quot; loop you get outside of the county park.  Bring extra treats for dogs, they will burn more energy than you would expect on this trail. </p>'

  sub_title: Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.
  overview: <p>This is one of the most secluded hikes within Cougar Mountain Park. Often you will have this trail to yourself with the exception of the occasional local trail runner. </p><p>There are two main entrances to the Licorice Fern Trail. The first, and longest route, is to hike from the Red Town parking area which would be about 8.5 miles round trip. However, if you are looking for a shorter route you can access the trail by parking at the 171st Ave cul-de-sac. There is plenty of curbside parking even on the busiest of weekends. </p><p>The trail starts off with little elevation gain. The trail can be wet and muddy at times as there are many small streams that form during the rainy season. As you make your way south you will need to cross a paved road to enter the second half of the trail. The trail becomes narrower and you will see quite a bit of elevation change as you make your way down through a ravine. For this part of the trail I would not suggest strollers as the trail is narrow and steep in areas. Overall the Licorice Fern Trail is a great hike if you are looking for a local secluded hike that provides you with the feeling of being miles from civilization. </p>

    <p>How to get here: </p><p>From I-90 East take Exit 13 and make a right at the stop sign.

  sub_title: 3.0 mile trail near Vancouver, Canada
  overview: |-
    <p>Lighthouse Park is an ecological reserve boasting old growth douglas firs and rock dating back 187 million years. It also contains a myriad of trails (both &quot;official&quot; and &quot;unofficial&quot; it would seem).&nbsp;</p><p>What to know:
    The trail surface in this park is rocky and filled with potential areas to twist an ankle. It's a little slow-going due to the need to step carefully at times!</p><p>Locating this park can be tricky. Though the directions via public transit seem easy enough, the bus stops in West Vancouver are not marked and the buses do not announce the stop names. I missed the stop on my first attempt, and only after careful googling did I find it the second time. So be on the lookout.&nbsp;</p><p>Paper maps are not available at any of the kiosks I came across. Be sure to bring your own. Though I managed to not get lost, it's easy to see how one might. </p><p>The pros:
    - It's beautiful here and that's reason enough to come!
    - The views and the (relatively) easy access to the shore made this park a great place to explore. I really enjoyed going down to the water and scrambling around a bit on the rocks.&nbsp;
    - I think you could come to this park more than once and experience it differently each time -- there are enough trails to walk a different configuration each time and I'm guessing, depending on whether it's high or low tide the shoreline would change too.&nbsp;</p><p>The cons:
    - This is another &quot;off leash&quot; park and locals take advantage of that. The pups here are eager &amp; friendly, but they do often run ahead of their owners meaning you encounter them often far before you encounter their owners.
    - Parts of the trail here are pretty challenging, particularly the trails on the east side of the park (Arbutus in particular). The are used less, which means you'll encounter fewer people, but they're more primitive with more difficult footing.&nbsp;
    - Though it's Lighthouse Park.. they're really aren't any views of the Lighthouse! The immediate area surrounding the lighthouse is restricted, so the only view you get is of the top 1/3.&nbsp;</p><p>
    From the parking area, I stayed to the right and entered the trails via Juniper Loop.&nbsp;I continued on the Shore Pine Trail until I reached Shore Pine Point at .37 miles.&nbsp;Staying on Shore Pine Trail, I reached a look out point and West Beach&nbsp;in another .22 miles. The West Beach trail is only .16 and definitely worth the short detour.&nbsp;Continuing on the Shore Pine Trail, I reached the Lighthouse View Point in another .2 miles (roughly 1 mile total at this point). From the View Point, I stayed to the right and detoured to East Beach - another short .2 miles that is steep, but worth it if you want to explore the shoreline.&nbsp;After a quick break, I looked for the Valley Trail to the right (and forgot to turn my Garmin back on here.. sigh) so I'm not sure how far I walked until I reached the Arbutus Trail turn off.&nbsp;</p><p>The Arbutus Trail is well marked and you'll know you're there because it's a steep ascent. I followed the Arbutus Trail and made the quick detour to Eagle Point (also worth the amazing view!) for .7 miles. As I mentioned, to me this was the most difficult part of the trail system.&nbsp;I then took the Summit Trail for .3 miles which led me back to the parking area. The trail in this area was a little confusing because all signs seemed to point different directions but lead you to the same place: the parking area.&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, the path I took was around 2.4 miles.&nbsp;The first portion of the trails are well used and contain relatively small rolling hills. The second portion (venturing onto the Valley Trail and the Arbutus Trail) are much steeper ascents. </p>
  tips: |-
    <p>Getting there:
    From downtown Vancouver, take bus #250 that travels along Georgia Street, across the Lions Gate Bridge and into West Vancouver. Be on the lookout for the &quot;Beacon Lane&quot; stop and a very small sign on the left hand side of the road for Lighthouse Park. From the stop, yo </p>

  overview: '<p>This hike is short in distance, but its second mile will wear you out!  Going off-trail up the No Alibi Ski Run, with undergrowth, uneven ground and rock is challenging.  The views and being off-trail makes an experience unlike any other on Mt. Spokane.  You really feel like you are one with the mountain.  Plus, as you approach the peak, having tourists who drove to the top look down to see you hiking upwards is well worth it.  </p><p>&bull; It is highly recommended to hike up the No Alibi Ski Run, it is at an incline where it is dangerous to attempt to hike it downward.  Going down the Mt. Spokane ski runs is better suited on the runs east of the Vista House. </p><p>&bull; Proper footwear, hiking boots with ankle support is HIGHLY recommended.  Wear liner socks.  Trekking poles to insure your footing and for extra power in getting up the mountain is also recommended.  If you have sensitive skin, wear long pants - the undergrowth can be punishing.</p><p>&bull; FYI: Bring extra water.  The ski run area sees upwards of 18 hours of sun per day during the summer.  As such, a wide brimmed hat is suggested.</p><p>&bull; DOGS: Make sure your dog is in shape to make this climb.  Not only do they have to deal with the steep incline, but they have to jump over and through undergrowth.

    &bull; Calories: 1096</p><p>&bull; Mt. Spokane State Park Trail 100 is 3.9 miles long.  It goes from the intersection of Mt. Spokane Drive and Summit Road, to Smith Gap.  What makes this trail great is its variation.  With a total length of 7.8 miles (out and back) it has a good amount of elevation gain and drop.  Plus four stream crossings - wear good footwear.  Due to trail damage on the upper section, Trail 100 is not a favorite of mountain bikers.  Further more, the lower section has steep elevation gains on either end, which further decreases the bike traffic. </p><p>&bull; It is a great trail for getting in hiking shape or to break in hiking gear - say your trying out a new pair of hiking boots.  It is also a great training trail, if you are getting in shape for say going up on Mt. Rainier, Mt. St. Helens (restricted in the number of people per day), or heading for a hiking vacation to the Colorado Rockies.  For training, add weight to your pack each time you hike, to build up endurance and altitude acclimation. </p><p>&bull; Mt. Spokane is a fee area, a Washington State Parks Discover Pass is required - $30 annual or $10 for single day use.

  title: Steamboat Rock Hike - Poliganders Family Hikes
  seo_title: steamboat-rock-hike-poliganders-family-hikes
  sub_title: 3.7 mile trail near Osborne, Washington
  overview: <p>Steamboat Rock Hike - Poliganders Family Hikes is about 3.7 miles long and located near Osborne, Washington. The trail is great for hiking and normally takes 1-3 hours.</p><p>We camped near this park and decided to hike the infamous Steamboat Rock. (If you are looking for a place to camp in this area, I&nbsp;highly recommend camping at Steamboat Rock. Although we didn&rsquo;t camp here, we spent most of our time taking advantage of the amenities they have to offer.)Our first attempt&nbsp;to hike Steamboat was with a group that had kids aged from&nbsp;3 years to 13. The first part of the hike from the parking lot to the climb&nbsp;was a simple task for them, however, once we reached the point of incline we decided to turn back.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a section that requires some maneuvering and scaling of the mountain that we thought was a little too much for the younger crowd. I will note though, not all parents heeded the same caution. I saw kids as young or younger headed up the trail. Another thing that surprised me was the amount of people that hiked this trail without any water. (This trail looks to have its busy days, so if your hiking to get away from the crowds, the first part of this hike will not be pleasant, however once you get to the top, you can venture away from humans as needed.)Our second attempt was the&nbsp;next day. Leaving the younger crowd behind, this time I hiked it with myself and three kiddos aged 11-13. Pay close attention to the surrounding area when you hike from the parking lot to the Mountain, there are plenty of deer that like to hang out under the few trees that offer shade. We saw more that 6 mule deer just in that short hike. Also note that this hike is like walking on the beach. The first section of the trail is mostly sand.Once reaching the &quot;climb&quot; area, also pay close attention, although it looks like only one trail up, there is a trail almost directly next to the &quot;most traveled&quot; that offers a much easier access. We didn&rsquo;t notice this easier access until our descent. It was more obvious from this point of view. Once you reach the top, you have the option to take the trail to the left or the right. We opted for the right since we could tell that it was give us a great view. It did not disappoint. The pictures just do not give it justice. There are quite a few trails to follow depending on what area you want to see, if you want to do a longer hike, you can make a day of it. We opted for a short hike, vowing to hike it again soon to access&nbsp;areas we didn&rsquo;t explore yet.Remember you are in rattlesnake country. We did see one&nbsp;pretty good size snake on our hike. We heard a few others that we didn&rsquo;t wait around to see.&nbsp;Having lived in rattlesnake country for most of my life, they have a&nbsp;distinct sound that can't be mistaken.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you're done with the hike, don't forget to visit the ice cream shop and get a nice swirl cone. Perfect after a long hike! You can also purchase a shirt that states &quot;I climbed Steamboat Rock&quot;. At a price of $16.95, the kids loved them.Other hikes in the area are Lenore Caves and Northrup. Search &quot;Poliganders&quot; for other hikes that we have posted and view comments and pics based on our experiences.Copied from http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/steamboat-rock:Steamboat Rock is a massive &quot;island&quot; of a rock mountain floating on the shore of Banks Lake. The durable rock was left behind through all of the Great Missoula Floods and was later nearly surrounded by the waters diverted by the Grand Coulee Dam. The top of the rock is a broad, flat plateau offering stunning views across the scablands of coulee country. </p>
  tips: <p>-Rattlesnake warning-Water is a must !!- I wouldnt recommend this hike for the younger kiddos (3-7) unless you are sure they will stick near you and listen very well. -Discover Pass Needed-Dogs allowed on a leash - pack plenty of water.-Take advantage of the bathroom near the parking area - as you can see from the last photo on the hike, we all had to go! </p>

  overview: <p>Located far from the park entrance you will have this trail to yourself. Rarely have I seen other hikers on this remote trail but that doesn't mean that there is nothing to be seen. You can easily spot small animals on this trail due to the infrequent use.</p><p>You will begin the trail by leaving either the Wildside or Red Town Trail. The trail starts off with a slight elevation gain and a few switchbacks, depending on the season you may also hear frogs near by. After a short incline the trail levels off and for the remainder of the trail stays fairly level. Moving along the trail you will feel alone deep in the forest but there are many new subdivisions that have been built along the edge of the park. The only time many of the houses are visible will be in the late fall and winter times when most of the foliage has retreated. As you head down the trail make sure to follow the larger dirt hiking trails. There are many unofficial trails that lead into the backyards of the new subdivisions; it will be easy to spot which the difference in trails. The only questionable fork in the trail is near the end. You will come to a large stump, about 7 feet tall and just as round, with a Marshall's Hill Trail marker in front of it. Stay to your left as the other path will lead you a long way down East Cross Town Trail towards the city of Newcastle. It will be easy to tell if you took the wrong trail, you should see a sign indicating the start of the Cougar Mountain Trail system about 100 yards down the trail. After making a right on the trail you are near the end, you will come to a short uphill climb followed by a paved road. The paved road is the end to the Marshall's Hill Trail and the start of the De Leo Wall Trail.</p><p>I would suggest continuing on the De Leo Wall trail as it is roughly the same distance back. There is a great look out point where you can see the city of Renton and on a clear day Mt. Rainier along the De Leo Wall Trail. </p>
  tips: "<p>How to get here: </p><p>From I-90 East take Exit 13 and make a right at the stop sign. Continue to follow Lakemont Blvd SE and the Red Town Trailhead parking lot will be on the left, about 3 miles away.

From the parking area you will see an information kiosk and a dirt path. There are three options at the fork in the trailhead.

To get here you can take a few routes, the quickest route is to take Wildside Trail and then take either the De Leo Wall Trail or Marshall's Hill Trail.

All of the side trails will lead you out of the Cougar Mountain Park, there will be blue signs indicating that you are leaving the park.

  overview: <p>A short 2 to 4 mile hike into the waterfall. There are two locations to park off of HWY 35 so make sure not to leave valuables in the car. The parking location shown on the map is from the Polallie trail head. Park and cross hwy 35 to a steep unmarked trail on the west side. Follow this trail south. It will connect with the Tamanawas fall trail after crossing Cold Spring Creek. Otherwise for a shorter more family friendly hike park about two miles south.This is the normal Tamanawas Falls parking area. The falls itself is a large falls with a large dry cave behind the falls. Rocks can be very slippery when wet so make sure to watch your step. The dry cave makes for a great finish to the hike and a great place to eat your lunch. Fairly popular trail so if you plan on bringing a dog make sure to bring the leash as well for those people who are scared of dogs. </p>
  tips: <p>This for the most part is a very easy hike in. simple dirt trail for the most part. Near the water fall there are large rocks which can be slippery from the mist of the falls. Regular hiking boots are recommended and of course some water. Pack in a lunch and eat at the falls. just remember if you pack it in make sure to pack it out. </p>

  sub_title: 'The only place on Hood where you can drive to the tree line and start your hike for quick views of glaciers.  '
  overview: '<p>Begin from the small campground at Cloud Cap. Hike 200 feet south to the intersection of the Timberline Trail #600, then follow the pointer to Gnarl Ridge uphill to the left. Stay left on the trail, avoiding an intersection created by climbers who use a short cut to the glacier. The Timberline Trail climbs gradually to the southeast, passing a canyon with running water, before it reaches the junction with the Cooper Spur Trail after 1.2 miles.  Turn right and switch back up Cooper Spur, look for the old shelter shortly after turning on to cooper spur. I recommend taking a few min to check out the small shelter. Continue up cooper spur, stopping at Tie-In Rock where the trail ends and the climbing route begins. Here is a spectacular viewpoint at 8,500 feet. There you''ll find a view of the north side of Mt Hood and the Elliot Glacier (2nd largest in Oregon).</p><p>(Note: this track is just short of Tie-In rock) </p>'
  tips: <p>Make sure to stop every so often once above the shelter and take a look behind you. On a clear day you can see Mt. St Helens AND Mt Adams. </p><p>Be sure to bring warm cloths even if its nice out because it gets cold as you get up near the glacier. Dont forget water and a snack its a ways down a bumpy dirt rd. back to town! </p><p>If you have time when you get back to the parking lot walk down to the old Cooper Spur Inn. Its no longer open to the public but its a neat place, and if your lucky a Crag Rat might be around and let you in or a tour! </p>

  sub_title: 'Hiking a lollipop-loop trail on the base of Mt. Hood from Sandy River to gorgeous Ramona Falls and back. '
  overview: <p>Ramona Falls drops 120 feet, cascading and splitting into ever smaller fingers of water broken up by the hexagonal columns of basalt at the base of the cliff.  The trail is relatively easy for this region, but the 1100 feet of elevation gain could require plenty of rest stops for those not used to hiking in the mountains.</p><p>Speed hikers could probably finish the trail in about 2.5 hours, but you&rsquo;ll want to spend some time at the falls and enjoy scenery along the way, so plan 4-6 hours.</p><p>The south leg of the loop to the falls is less scenic and bogs down with sand in a few spots, but it&rsquo;s still an enjoyable, well maintained trail with some nice views on the way to the falls.  After the falls, the return trip on the north leg is wonderful, following the lush, green path of Ramona Creek and skirting towering cliffs before veering south to head back towards the trailhead. </p>
  tips: |-
    <p>A critical, temporary bridge early in the trail is removed each winter, so don't try this hike during winter.</p><p>Be sure to get a National Forest Recreation Pass ($5.00) or one of the various annual passes that cover the area.

  title: Mt. Hood Via South Side Timberline Approach
  seo_title: mt-hood-via-south-side-timberline-approach
  sub_title: Standard Route with optional ski descent
  overview: '<p>Mt. Hood is the tallest mountain (and volcano) in the state of Oregon.  At 11,239 feet (3426 meters) it is truly a worthy alpine ascent.  The volcano last erupted in 1907 and was first climbed by W.S. Buckley, W.L. Chittenden, James Deardorff, H.L. Pittock and L.J. Powell in 1857.  The mountain lies 50 miles east of Portland and is considered by some to be the most likely Oregon volcano to erupt in the future although it is now dormant and there have been no recent signs of threatening activity despite having many active fumaroles.  </p><p>Mt. Hood is an amazing climb.  It has been estimated that over 10,000 people attempt to climb the mountain each year.  This high number of climbers has also led to a high level of injuries and deaths on the mountain.  Over 130 climbers have now perished while trying to reach the summit.   The climb is not an extremely difficult alpine ascent but in order to safely reach the summit a good understanding of glacier travel, route finding, and use of a rope and ice axe is essential.  The route described in this guide is considered the standard and most popular (easiest and fastest) route to the summit.  </p><p>The route basically follows a CAT groomer path up from the Timberline Lodge past the Silcox Hut to the top of the Palmer chairlift.  This first part is easy going, more of a slog than an alpine climb.  Climbers should stay on the climbers path and try to avoid climbing up any ski slopes (especially during late or early ski season).  Once at the same elevation as the top of the Palmer Lift you are on your own for the rest of the climb.</p><p>Continue up snowfields towards Crater Rock which looks like a castle or pyramid of rock in the middle of the summit crater.  You will want to enter what is called the &quot;devils kitchen&quot; on the right side of Crater Rock.  On your right you will see giant vertical cliffs named &quot;Steel Cliffs&quot;  On your way up to this area be aware that on climbers left there is a pumice ridge with the White River Glacier on the other side of this.  In areas this ridge is very steep and you will want to avoid straying towards it as you may find yourself sliding down towards White River Glacier below!  </p><p>When you find yourself in the Devils Kitchen it would be prudent to put a climbing helmet on as rock fall from this point onward can be very dangerous, especially during hot days in the late spring and summer.  From here follow the climbers path up the &quot;Hogsback&quot;, a steep snow ridge leading up to what looks like cliffs behind Crater Rock.   When climbing this route be aware that you will be approaching a large bergschrund (a crevasse that forms when moving ice, in this case the Coalman glaicer, pulls away from stagnant ice above).  Usually this is skirted by staying to climbers right although the exact location of the Hogsback is known to shift, sometimes by many meters, each year.  My advice is to stick to the established climbers path for that given year.  </p><p>Once above the bergschrund there are generally two chutes that should get you up through the &quot;Pearly Gates&quot; onto the final summit slope.  Sometimes this standard route can become backed up with climbers so another option would be to head to climbers left about halfway up the Hosback to climb the &quot;Old Crater&quot; variation.  This route is very steep but it brings you up onto the summit slope just a little bit to the West of where the Pearly Gates route brings you.  </p><p>Once on the summit slope it is an easy stroll to the summit.  I can''t express enough the need for common sense at the summit.  Depending on the time of year there can be very large cornices overhanging the northeast face of the mountain.  Straying too close to the edge may trigger one to collapse with you on it, which would not be a fun ending to the climb (read: you die).  </p><p>Take lots of photos at the top enjoy your time at the top of Oregon as long as weather and your comfort permit.  Head back down cautiously the same way you came up.  Remember that going down is always scarier than going up so be careful and take your time. </p><p>If you do not have any prior alpine experience and are concerned about the difficulty of this trip I would highly recommend you contact Timberline Mountain Guides or the Mazamas which both offer guided ascents and alpine climbing instruction.  Both can be easily found via a quick internet search.  </p><p>If you do decide to tackle this mountain without a guide please please please go with a friend and let others know when and where you are going (what route) before you leave home.  This is a day hike but understand that under the hot sun snow melts quickly and trying to walk up (or down) through almost two feet of what feels like mashed potatoes will quickly become exhausting.  As my girlfriend is well aware, it is not easy to get up at 2 or 3 am to start a climb but trust me you will move much quicker if you do.  It will be personal preference as to when you will want to put on your snowshoes or crampons.  Often you can walk all the way up the climbers trail to the top of the Palmer lift in just your boots.  A good goal for time management will be to try to reach the Crater Rock Area by dawn or slightly after.  </p><p>Lastly, if you are a skier this climb gives you several options.  You have the option of possibly taking the Palmer Lift up but it opens after 9am and will set you back a little bit on time.  You also have the choice of skinning up the trail to Crater Rock if you have an AT or telemark setup.  Trust me, going down on skis is way more fun than down-climbing through thick melting snow!  I would not suggest trying to ski from the summit unless you are truly an expert skier. </p><p>I am not an alpine guide but I have climbed nearly all the Cascade Volcanoes via their standard routes over the past 4 years and have gained a lot of experience in the alpine environment by doing so.  This Cascade climbing guide as well as others from me are based on my experience climbing the routes and serve only as a very rough guide to the routes I took.  If you are an inexperienced climber please please hire a guide service or take an instructional alpine climbing class before attempting any of these climbs! </p>'
  tips: <p>I can't stress enough here the need to be prepared for an alpine climb such as this.  First you will need the right equipment.  For this climb I would suggest a climbing helmet for rockfall hazards above Crater Rock, an Ice Axe for both glacier travel and ascending the steep chutes near the top and definitely crampons &amp; snowhoes for secure purchase on the slippery slopes.   Besides these essential pieces of gear I would suggest warm clothing (don't bring cotton as it gets wet and drains your heat), two pairs of gloves in case one gets wet, two pairs of socks and a super warm hat.  Weather is often dangerous and rolls in quick so be prepared.  Some may say it is overkill but I like to bring a lightweight bivouac bag and a warm sleeping bag (or a down/synthetic pants/top combo).  A good modern sleeping bag and bivy shouldn't weigh more than 4 pounds and it could save your life.  I would especially suggest this if the weather looks iffy.  A good pair of boots is also essential.  Oh... and if you ski... bring em! You can drop them at Devil's Kitchen for a fun and fast ride down.</p><p>As of time of year I would suggest late spring after the avalanche season has, for the most part ended.  You will want an early start from the Timberline Parking area of about 2 or 3 in the morning to prevent sludging through 2 feet of melting &quot;mash potato snow&quot; on the way up.  Wearing a headlamp you should make it to the top of the Palmer lift by dawn and it is relatively easy to that point. </p>

  title: Trail of the Coeur d' Alenes
  seo_title: trail-of-the-coeur-d-alenes
  sub_title: 'Smooth as a baby''s bottom, this trail cuts through northern Idaho wildlands on its journey from mountains to lake. '
  overview: |-
    <p>What's not to love about the Trail of the Couer d' Alenes? It's smoothly paved, satisfyingly lengthy, incredibly peaceful, and available to users of all types. In addition to biking and all the other activities listed above, it's also well suited to use by inline skaters, Trikke riders, and recumbent cyclists. In fact, Trail of the Couer d' Alenes is the preferred trail for alternative human-powered vehicles of all kinds and it is also a featured trail for many international active travel companies to lead multi-day tours.
    You do not have to be a world class cyclist to enjoy the Trail of the Couer d' Alenes. People of all ages, interests, backgrounds, sizes, and shapes enjoy the trail every day. It is quite appealing to have access to 72 miles of smooth asphalt that is mostly downhill if you are traveling from east to west. This makes it a perfect venue for family gatherings and mixed groups. </p>
  tips: |-
    <p>- Even though the trail is surrounded by rivers, streams, and lakes, bring plenty of your own water. It is not advisable to drink the water from nearby waterways.
    - Cell phone service is spotty in some areas, so don't rely on a mobile phone as your only communication method.
    - Although pets are allowed on the trail, they should be kept on a fairly short leash and under constant supervision. Always pick up after your pet and deposit their &quot;trail donations&quot; in the proper receptacles. </p>

  sub_title: 'Start at the Montana/Idaho border and explore 10 tunnels, 7 trestles and 15 miles of Idaho history, scenery and wildlife '
  overview: |-
    <p>Begin your odyssey in Montana and immediately plunge deep underground to surface in Idaho where you'll stay for the rest of your historic wanderings.
    The Route of the Hiawatha may very well be the pride of America when it comes to trails. Descriptions can be exaggerated, but the sheer numbers can't lie. The trail is studded with ten tunnels (The longest is 8771 feet long.), seven trestles (The highest is 850 feet long and 230 feet high.), dozens of educational signs, thousands of trees and animals, hundreds of... Well, hopefully you get the picture.
    And while numbers don't lie, they also can't come close to describing the beauty and grandeur of this Idaho classic. A true trail fanatic could ride the Route of the Hiawatha and its nearby cousin, the Trail of the Couer d' Alenes and be in trail heaven.
    To access this trail, find Interstate 90, then turn off at either exit 61 if approaching from the Idaho side or exit 5 if approaching from the Montana side. It is a good idea to visit the website links provided with this guide for information about the trail fee, shuttle service, and bike rentals.
    Follow the path of the Milwaukee Road and enjoy a perfect path to paradise on the Route of the Hiawatha. </p>
  tips: |-
    <p>- There is a fee for using the trail, but it is well worth the modest price. It is $8 for adults &amp; $4 for children ages 3-13.
    - If you only want to ride the trail downhill, you can pay $9 for a shuttle bus ride to the top.
    - You absolutely want to take a light with you. Handlebar mounted lights are best and helmet/head mounted lights work almost as well. You also want to consider bringing a rear light, if possible. A couple of the tunnels are very long and dark and none of the tunnels have lighting. Lights are available for rent/loan at some of the local bike rental businesses.
    - Definitely dress in layers. It can get quite warm on the trail yet be surprisingly cold and breezy in the tunnels.
    - Write ahead &amp; have a brochure sent to you so you can get current shuttle hours, trail fees, rental information, etc. Follow the link in the right margin of this guide to find the Hiawatha Trail websites. </p>

But was cancelled due to the terrible weather conditions in the area at the time. The 10 in 10 is a charity walk held each year to raise donations for the MS charity.This years route officially begins at the Swinside Inn and follows a circuit of 10 peaks starting with Causey Pike and the last peak being High spy. Officially you descend back to Swinside running parallel with Catbells not going over it.The order of peaks are:Causey PikeSail FellEel CragWandopeWhiteless PikeSnockriggRobinsonDale HeadMaiden MoorHigh SpyOur team, &quot;Vertically Challenged&quot; felt bad about accepting sponsorship money without doing the full challenge, so we decided to do it ourselves. The weather proved problematic along with scheduling the event around a date all of us could do it.We completed the trip just under 10 hours. We could have done this quicker but &nbsp;I suffered a stomach bug that slowed the team down on the ascent to Robinson. We had mixed fortunes with the weather. It set off overcast but the sun came out as we were ascending Snockrigg.On the summit of Robinson thunder storms appeared all around us. Although we they never got on top of us the rain finally did when we reached the 10th peak - High spy. </p>
  tips: <p>Very&nbsp;strenuous&nbsp;walkFull day of walkingTake plenty of food and water - I used up nearly 4 litres of waterPack clothing for all conditionsNot child friendly.You could half the walk and finish at after Whiteless Pike and walk into Buttermere.

  overview: <p>Bommer Ridge to Crystal Cove is about 10.3 miles long and located near Newport Coast, California. The trail is great for hiking and normally takes a half day.</p><p>Started at Ridge Park  ( off Newport Coast Dr., Newport Beach CA - drive to end). </p><p>It's a popular area on the weekends, so do NOT wear headphones - you need to hear bikers and runners as they approach you from behind. We took Bommer Ridge to Moro Ridge. &nbsp;There is a generic map on web, but the map posted along the trails showed more trails than the map on the web. It got a little confusing (thankfully they post a &quot;You are here&quot; button on their maps), but basically we followed the Bommer Ridge trail that was wide and did not veer off to the narrow paths. &nbsp;You can see in photos 6 and 8, the discrepancy. &nbsp;My descriptions to you are based on the web map (photo 8).</p><p>We passed Upper and Lower Moro Campgrounds (which looked pretty desolate), down to the Moro Campground. &nbsp;Our starting elevation was at about 1000 feet, and we went down to 0, which was at the Moro Campground. Here, there is a nice ranger station, with maps and bathrooms, and resting areas. </p><p>Then of course, we climbed back up via No Dog and No Name Ridge to complete our loop. &nbsp;This track was moderately strenuous. </p><p>(there are 3 icons in the lower right corner of the map, slideshow mode - statistics mode and &nbsp;settings. &nbsp;Click on Statistic mode to see elevation and speed throughout the hike).</p><p>For 6 miles more, you can start down in Shady Canyon's Bommer Canyon parking lot. See my guide on Bommer Meadow. &nbsp;From Bommer Canyon parking, it's 3 miles up to Park Ridge, so that would add a total of 6 miles to this hike, if you are testing your endurance levels. </p>
  tips: <p>IF you start in morning with clouds, they can clear up. &nbsp;Dress in layers, and bring a hat. For 10 miles, I suggest plenty of water, and perhaps a banana or apple or tangerine snack.</p><p>Steep inclines and declines - if you have knee problems, bring your trekking poles.</p><p>There are outhouses along the way, and it's a nice rear stop at Ranger station at Moro Campground.  Beautiful views of coastline.</p><p>Be in good shape. Last photo shows you the site at our finish point....someone need help on the trai.  Come prepared, you don't want this scene for yourself. </p>

  sub_title: 10.9 mile trail near Irvine County, California
  overview: <p>Limestone Canyon is about 10.9 miles long and located near Irvine County, California. The trail is great for hiking and normally takes a full day.</p><p>Limestone Canyon is not open to the public, except for special days. &nbsp;This was one of them.We accessed it off of E Santiago Canyon Rd, just past Trabuco Canyon (coming from coast). &nbsp;The Augustine Staging area was the designated &quot;register&quot; site. &nbsp;You will see a photo of the maps they posted in the staging area, identifying routes as easy, moderate or strenuous. &nbsp;Ours was moderately strenuous for recreational hikers.From there, we set out on what we thought was going to be 13 miles, but ended up being 11 (if EveryTrail's tracking is correct). &nbsp;I do think it was closer to &nbsp;12-13 miles, as EveryTrail shows us making a straight line back to base, and ignores our mileage on the ridge. &nbsp;And in general, we walk 3 mph, and hike at about 2.5 mph, so that would put us at 12.5 miles ( 2.5 x 5). &nbsp;So call it 12 miles to be safe.We set out on the new ShoeString Trail, which unfortunately runs parallel to Santiago Canyon Rd. &nbsp;But after about 2 miles, it puts you on track to go inward, away from traffic, and this was quite nice. &nbsp;There were some steep hills, and we passed several bikers and walkers who had stopped to rest. &nbsp;So it is do-able regardless of your level, just pace yourself.The highest elevation gains came at 4.7 miles, and again at 6.1 miles, both times reaching approximately 1700 feet. </p><p>We decided to do the outward Ridges, since that gave us the highest elevation gain and mileage (and the most challenge). &nbsp;There were quite a few uphills and downhills, so those with knee problems might want to bring trekking poles.The Raptors were nesting, and we did see some nests, as well as the rare white tailed kite. (he's in one of our photos, but we just use an iPhone, so he is a tiny spec).The EveryTrail tracking (red marking on map) did not quite &quot;jive&quot; with what we actually did (the straight red line on map was really a jagged line along one of the ridges, and photos didn't get assigned correct to their locations for several reasons), so here was our route:Shoestring t&gt; West Loma &gt;East Loma &gt; The Sinks &gt; Cactus Cyn &gt; Limestone Ridge &gt; the Raptor, (a cutover to Limestone Cyn to avoid 2nd half of Limestone Ridge which is loose rock and tricky) &gt; Augustine staging. &nbsp;I would say this was a strenuous hike, and you can see it in how long it took us, and we did not stop to rest. &nbsp;We did slow down in nesting area to observe, but never halted, and moved quickly on flat land.All in all, a beautiful hike with lots of vistas of Irvine Lake, Orange, and the surrounding areas. &nbsp;The wildflowers are all out now, and are just beautiful. </p>
  tips: <p>I would rate our route as strenuous, but there are more moderate routes. &nbsp;Lots of steep elevation gains - be prepared. &nbsp;(be sure your toe nails are trimmed!). &nbsp;Take lots of water, and wear a hat. &nbsp;Rangers were on the trail by bike, foot, car and horse, to be assured no one needed assistance.  Great challenging hike. </p>

We had some exercise training before the trip and we loved the challenge so we took it for 4 days. </p><p>The distance was not a problem ~20km per day. Neither we had problems with our legs, despite my blisters. The thing that got us were our backpacks. As an unexperienced hikers, we took too much stuff! My backpack was the killing 20kg and my girlfriend's one 15kg.</p><p>At first you dont feel the backpack but after 5,6 hours of treking it feels like rock on your back. If we had 10kg less weight it would have been a breeze. Now it was hard at times. Especially on the hardest Day 3.</p><p>We sleped only at Huts because we did not have a tent.
    We regret it though during the trip, because there were unbelivably wonderful places for camping. </p><p>The Chez guys we were meeting in Rila were camping everywhere. </p>

  seo_title: 4-mile-trail-yosemite
  sub_title: Valley floor to Glacier Point
  overview: <p>This trip starts out of Yosemite Valley floor and is about 9.4 miles round trip and 3300ft elevation change. This is a difficult hike. The GPS trail on this hike is off on the trip up, but accurate on the downside trip. </p><p>Parking is available on the side of the road, but you will have to compete with people stopping to look and enjoy the scenery. There are no facilities here so be sure you do what you need to do before starting or you will have to be a bit more creative ;). Be sure to bring PLENTY of water. This trail is a combination of shaded area's and sunny area's. It was about 75 degree's when we hiked but it felt a lot warmer. </p><p>Basically, this trail is up, up, and more up. The views of the valley are spectacular. The view of course changes the higher you get. Great views of Yosemite falls, Sentinal Dome, El Capitan, Half Dome as you climb up. The end of the trail puts you at the visitor center at Glacier point. </p><p>Of course, the views of the valley, Half dome, and Nevada Falls, as well as the back country are great. (You can drive up here, but that would be missing all the fun). There are facilities available and water (even ice cream). </p><p>The trip down, while not as strenuous as the trip up, requires your attention due to the decomposed granite. The trail can be very slippery (I call it walking on ball bearings). </p>
  tips: <p>Bring lots of water. Walking sticks might be helpful on the trip down.</p>

  overview: <p>TVA Raccoon Mountain is my favorite place to run. With a variety of trail options and unmatched views of the surrounding mountains the venue is an example of what can happen when you allow recreational access to public land. It is clean, well used and represents the nature of the city and surrounding area. Thanks to the members of SORBA for the time, money and ongoing efforts to build and maintain these trails. This route is the shortest route around the reservoir using the trails. There are great views, a couple of climbs, rocks, roots and creeks and a pond. </p>
  tips: <p>Carry water. Be alert for mountain bikers while on the trails, I just step aside and let 'em go. Park at East Overlook. Do not leave valuables in car. TVA has gone to private security this year and there have been break-ins. East Overlook is safer because of a higher volume of traffic. The trails get pretty busy in the evenings and weekends. Be gone before sunset. </p>

  overview: <p>9.4 miler Bommer Cyn to Laguna Trails is located near Irvine, California. The trail is great for hiking and normally takes about 3 hours or 3.5, all depending on your pace, of course.</p><p>I did this to give you an extended hike out of Bommer Canyon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Trails are good, area is quiet.  You do see several other hikers, runners and bikers.  </p><p>Travel in on Shady Canyon Road, and about 1.5 - 2 miles in, you will see a right turn into Bommer Canyon (there is no light , and the driveway sneaks up on you).  </p><p>If you are lucky enough to get one  of the 14 parking spots, this will be your starting point.  Otherwise, you can park nearby and walk in for another 7/10 mile (one direction).&nbsp;&nbsp;If the parking lot at Bommer Canyon is full, continue down Shady Canyon Road to Springhill, and turn left.  Park in lot on your left, in the area for &quot;trail parking&quot;. Signs will guide  you to the trail, and add 1.4 miles to the mileage I have listed here, for an accurate round-trip accounting.There are bathrooms, water, and a picnic table at base of Bommer Canyon.  And a large map of trails is posted, although for this hike we continue on and switch to Laguna maps.  The Laguna maps are shown in the photos.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you do start out, you meander through the fields, over a couple of bridges.  Within the first mile, you have a choice between Nature Loop and Bommer Meadow; choose the Nature Loop.  Just follow the trail.  It leads you nicely, and you really can't go wrong. &nbsp;First 1 mile is slightly inclined (from picnic area).  Hills are dotted with impressive homes, which you will soon be leaving behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;At about  1.8 miles, there is a fork in the road (Turtle Ridge vs West Fork).  Take West Fork trail (to your left), it is uphill for next 1 mile.  Not too tricky, but hiking shoes help.  You do get a break at about .65 miles up - a little flat area as you go under the 73 toll road, then steep incline to top (Park Ridge).</p><p>At Park Ridge you will find several new trails to explore.For this hike, we choose Bommer Ridge, and followed it to post 8. &nbsp;At Post 8, we headed towards ocean to Red Tail Ridge, then down Ticketron to meet back up with NoName, which returns us to Park Ridge. From there, we just followed our path in - returning down West Fork to Bommer.The photos show you the trails, and the Laguna maps. </p>
  tips: <p>Ticketron can be slippery.  Hiking shoes recommended.  Hat and std gear always recommended.</p>

  title: A Circuit of Howth
  seo_title: a-circuit-of-howth
  sub_title: Enjoy stunning scenery as you follow the clifftop paths around the Howth peninsula.
  overview: <p>The Howth peninsula forms the northern tip of Dublin Bay and has long been a popular destination for daytrippers keen to explore its fishing village, its hills and sea cliffs. Despite its proximity to Dublin city, it largely retains a wild, remote feel on account of its relative isolation from the rest of the mainland. This guide explores the harbour area around Howth Village before rambling along the clifftop path around the peninsula, returning over the central hills and via the grounds of Howth Castle.</p><p>The geology of the peninsula is predominantly quartzite and with rocks dating from the Cambrian period, approximately 550 million years ago, making them among the oldest rocks in Ireland. Evidence of human habitation on the peninsula dates back to at least 3,500 BC. Howth is depicted in a 2nd century map of Ireland by the Alexandrian scholar, Ptolemy, as a small island named Edri Deserta, or Edar's Desert. This suggests that the Sutton Isthmus, which connects Howth to the mainland, only formed in the last 1,900 years. The name Howth originates in the Norse word, Hofuth, meaning headland, and dates from the time of the Viking settlement of the Dublin area.  The Irish name for Howth, Binn &Eacute;adair, may mean Hill of Edar, referring to one of the Tuatha D&eacute; Dannan tribe, believed to be buried on the Ben of Howth, or it may be a corruption of Ben na Dair, meaning Hill of the Oaks.</p><p>The Vikings arrived in 819 AD and established Howth as an important seaport. Following their defeat at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, many of the survivors fled to Howth, where they were left to settle in peace. A number of surnames common to the Howth area, such as Harford, Thunder, Rickard and Waldron, are of Norse origin. The Norsemen remained at Howth until the Norman invasion of Ireland when they were defeated by the Norman knight Almeric Tristram on St Laurence's Day, 10 August 1177. Tristram took the surname St Laurence in honour of his victory and established his estate at Howth Castle. The castle has remained in the ownership of the St Laurence family ever since, although the unbroken line of male succession came to an end in 1909.</p><p>Isolated from the rest of Dublin, Howth existed as a sleepy fishing village for most of its history until the early 19th century when it was selected to serve as the port for the mail packet ship service to Britain. The harbour at Howth was opened in 1818 but suffered from problems with silting and the packet ship relocated to Dun Laoghaire in 1834. The harbour remains home to a substantial fishing fleet and the village is now a smart suburb of Dublin thanks to the DART railway service. The village and the cliff path draws many tourists throughout the year. </p>
  tips: <p>The cliff path is rather exposed in certain sections and it is not recommended during stormy weather. You should always bring a waterproof and windproof jacket given the changeable nature of the Irish weather. The terrain varies from paved paths to rough tracks, with the southern section of the cliff path particularly uneven. Nevertheless, flat trail shoes with good grip should suffice.</p><p>The best way to get to Howth is via the DART. Car parking is available at the harbour but spaces may be at a premium, especially on fine weekends.</p><p>There are numerous options for refreshments in Howth village. </p>

And don't forget the sunscreen. </p><p>This park was established to protect outstanding seasonal displays of native wildflowers, in particular the California Poppy, our state flower. The park includes  seven miles of trails winding through wildflower fields, hilltops, and a lovely spring-fed desert valley. </p><p>The wildflower blooms generally happen from March through May with the peak viewing period in Mid-April. The best poppy showing occurs when the temperature is over 70F and wind is less than 10mph.</p><p>In season watch for:\nPoppies, filaree, fiddleneck, silver puff, pygmy-leaved lupine, bush lupine, lacey phacelia, slender keel fruit, forget-me-not, fringe pod, wild onions, red maids, sun cups, gold fields, owl's clover, hairy lotus, cream cups and rattlesnake weed.</p><p>Please Note: rattlesnakes are out! \nThe Mojave green rattlesnakes can be active in the daytime on cool-to-warm days. They come out in the evenings on hot days. Rattlesnakes are not aggressive and will not attack unless startled or threatened. When you approach they almost always make you aware of their presence, as they want to avoid a confrontation. </p><p>If you encounter one on a trail, it will most likely move out of your way if you just hang back and give it space. </p><p>Keep in mind, rattlesnakes are an important part of the food web and without them, rodents could rapidly overpopulate and consume the flowers that the park is famous for.

  overview: '<p>The elephant seals at A&ntilde;o Nuevo State Reserve are not pretty, but they live pretty well. In fact, they''re living out one of the world''s greatest escapes from extinction.</p><p>Things have been getting better for the elephant seals of the Pacific Coast in the century since humans stopped slaughtering them: Their population has recovered from hundreds to over a hundred thousand.</p><p>Now thousands of northern elephant seals come to A&ntilde;o Nuevo and a few other beaches in California and Mexico to breed. Watching their reproductive antics is one of the best wildlife experiences available in California -- the closest you''re likely to come to any large mammals as they go about their business of making babies.</p><p>You''ll be amazed at how many of elephant seals fill A&ntilde;o Nuevo at the height of the season. It''ll look like a seal civilization, and you can learn all their laws on the guided tours. </p>'
  tips: "<p>Elephant seals are immense, dangerous wild animals (an adult male weighs as much as your car).

  overview: "<p>This is a historic mining area along the south side of the Salmon River near Burgdorf, Idaho. There are also some active mines in the area. The Frank Church - River of No Return Wilderness borders this district on the north and east. The elevation ranges from about 6000' to 8500'.</p><p>Most of the mines are private property and the owners wishes should be respected. It also indicates that access could be changed at any time.</p><p>My GPS tracks in the mining area are kind of scrambled, probably due to the steep terrain and trees, but all follow roads/trails. If the track indicates going over the side of the mountain, stay on the road next to it!</p><p>There are more mines, shafts, and structures in this immediate area that I have not explored, but these will get you started.</p><p>Mine shafts and structures should not be entered due to the danger that old dynamite and chemicals could be stored within. There is also a danger of cave-ins due to decayed timber in the mines. Be careful!</p><p>The main road (FR 318) to the mining area can be traveled by automobile, but a high clearance vehicle is better.

The graveled road to the north, goes to Burgdorf, Idaho and on to the Salmon River.</p><p>This is a very scenic area. Summit Creek parallels the paved part of the Warren Wagon Road, with meadows on both sides of the road at times. It is a good area to view big game. I have seen moose, deer, elk, bear, and wolves along this road.</p><p>Josephine Lake is a beautiful high mountain lake and it is just a short hike from the trail head. The trail is well marked.</p><p>If you see government employees at the fish counting station (Look for government license plates on vehicles there!) visit with them.

  overview: '<p>The Magruder Road Corridor extends 95 miles through a vast undeveloped area, offering solitude and pristine beauty, as well as expansive views of the Bitterroot and Clearwater Mountains. It has been known as the Southern Nez Perce Trail, Elk City to Darby Road, Montana Road, and the Parker Trail.</p><p>The road enables a traveler to drive along a corridor between Wildernesses nearly twice as large as the combined states of Delaware and Rhode Island. To the north is the 1.2 million acre Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness and to the south the 2.2 million acre Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness.</p><p>This is probably one of the wildest roads in the United States. Its unspoiled beauty cannot be surpassed, as the landscape is much the same as when the Nez Perce Indians and early travelers crossed the area.</p><p>The Magruder Road (Forest Road #468) is a single-lane mostly unimproved road which is rocky, steep and winding, with few turnouts for passing oncoming vehicles. The road is not recommended for low-clearance vehicles, motor homes, or vehicles towing trailers. The video in POI #35 (Hell''s Half Acre Lookout Road #224) shows typical road conditions that you may expect. The road traverses a vast, remote, and rugged area. Travelers should take adequate provisions and make sure their vehicles are in good condition. Don''t run out of gas!</p><p>Options on how to visit this area will depend on your individual choices. Starting in either Idaho or Montana will be the first decision. Staying in a hotel, cabin, RV, or tent are all possible in this area. The type of vehicle or the amount of time you want to spend hiking trails into the Wildernesses will also be factors. Just driving the road in a high clearance vehicle will take 8 to 10 hours.</p><p>The mountain bikers we met on the trail were being followed by a 4X4 bag wagon carrying their camping gear. ATVs and motorcycles are limited by the amount of fuel and camping gear they can carry. The Burnt Knob LO will require a 4X4 or a willingness to hike uphill for about 1 1/2 miles.</p><p>The road from the Montana side is OK for ATV and horse trailers to the Magruder Ranger Station and Selway River and might be considered as part of your planning. RVs can access the Fales Flat Campground from the Montana side of the corridor.</p><p>Whatever your choices, this trip will require multiple days. Take your time and enjoy it.</p><p>There is no cell phone service in this area.</p><p>The mileage figures in the POIs from the Red River Ranger Station to Darby, MT do not include any side trips off FR 468. The mileage figures were obtained from the USFS.</p><p>Contact numbers are in the Elk City and West Fork Ranger Station POIs in this guide for current road conditions, weather, and other info. </p>'
  tips: |-
    <p>Depending on the seasons' snowfall, the road is usually clear by July and open through September, sometimes a little longer. It gets cold in October.

  overview: <p>To find the trailhead, take the forest road opposite the Cinnamon Lodge in Gallatin Canyon which is south of Big Sky and the Corral Restaurant and Bar.  You drive just a short distance (maybe 1/2 mile) to the trailhead.  </p><p>The trail follows Cinnamon Creek for 2.5 miles to a junction where it then goes up a ridge to the lookout.  The trail if good in most places, but horses that have used the trail too early have trashed it up in the wet spots making it difficult to find a dry way through in a couple of places.  You can have lunch just over the saddle at a spot with great views of the Taylor-Hilgard Basin.  Worth the little side trip.</p><p>The trail continues through open meadows and aspen/pine timber to the top.  The top is 9231 feet and there are spectacular views in all directions.  A sign at the top indicates various distant peaks. </p>
  tips: <p>Head up early to avoid getting caught in the afternoon thunder storms.&nbsp; We got hail, rain and wind about 1/2 mile before the trailhead and the trail gets really slick once it starts raining.&nbsp; So, bring a raincoat and trekking poles--they will help keep you from sliding around in the mud. </p>

  title: Norris Geyser Basin - Yellowstone National Park
  seo_title: norris-geyser-basin-yellowstone-national-park
  sub_title: Norris Geyser Basin is one of the hottest and most dynamic of Yellowstone's hydrothermal areas.
  overview: "<p>The information for this guide was taken from the Norris Geyser Basin Trail Guide, which is available at the trailhead.</p><p>Norris is outside the Yellowstone Caldera, but inside the first and largest caldera.</p><p>Norris is one of the most active earthquake areas in the park.</p><p>This is one of the most acidic hydrothermal areas in Yellowstone.</p><p>Many acidic geysers, which are rare in the rest of the world, are here.</p><p>Steamboat Geyser is the tallest active geyser in the world.</p><p>Norris Geyser Basin is one of the hottest and most dynamic of Yellowstone's hydrothermal areas. Many hot springs and fumaroles have temperatures above the boiling point (200&deg;F) here. Water fluctuations and seismic activity often change features.</p><p>It's hard to imagine a setting more volatile than Norris. It is part of one of the world's largest active volcanoes. And it sits on the intersection of three major faults. One runs from the north; another runs from the west. These two faults intersect with a ring fracture from the Yellowstone Caldera eruption 640,000 years ago. These conditions helped to create this dynamic geyser basin.</p><p>Changing</p><p>Each year at Norris new hot springs and geysers appear; others become dormant. Geologic events cause many of these changes. Even small earthquakes can trigger changes in hydrothermal behavior. Some changes are brief; others last longer.</p><p>Geysers and hot springs may also create changes in themselves. Some Norris hot springs, like Cistern, rapidly dissolve underground rock. As hot water moves toward the surface, the dissolved minerals deposit along subterranean passages and around the surface vents. Eventually, these deposits can choke off the flow of water. New features may be born as hot, pressurized water seeks a route to the surface.</p><p>Unpredictable</p><p>Some features in Norris Geyser Basin can undergo dramatic behavioral changes simultaneously. Clear pools become muddy and boil violently, and some temporarily become geysers. Geysers cease erupting or have altered cycles. New features appear. This sudden activity is known as a &quot;thermal disturbance&quot; and can last a few days or more than a week. Gradually, most features return to &quot;normal.&quot;</p><p>Why this happens is not fully understood. Norris has the greatest water chemistry diversity among Yellowstone's hydrothermal areas. Multiple underground hot water reservoirs exist here and as their water levels fluctuate, concentrations of chloride, sulfate, iron, and arsenic change. Although Norris is known for its acid features, it also has alkaline hot springs and geysers. As underground waters and chemistry shift, they could contribute to sudden dramatic changes in minerals and pH. Further study will help unravel the mystery of this phenomenon.</p><p>The Colors of Norris</p><p>Many of the colors you see here are evidence of thermophiles (heat-loving microorganisms) and their activity.</p><p>Yellow deposits here typically contain sulfur. They form when hydrogen sulfide gas (the rotten egg odor you may have noticed) is converted to sulfur. Some thermophiles live in these areas because they use chemicals like sulfur for energy. They form communities of mats and streamers (formations that look like waving clumps of hair) in the hottest acidic runoff, which measure between 140&deg;F and 181&deg;F.</p><p>Dark brown, rust, and red colors abound in Norris and contain varying amounts of iron. Red-brown mats may also contain bacteria and archaea that help build the mats by metabolizing and depositing iron. These iron-oxide deposits often contain high levels of arsenic. These communities form in water below 140&deg;F.</p><p>Emerald-green mats color many of the runoff channels of hot springs and geysers here. Algae are the dominant life forms in these mats and contain chlorophyll, a green pigment that helps convert sunlight to energy. Some bacteria and archaea grow in these mats, which form below 133&deg;F.</p><p>Dark blackish-green mats form in even cooler water. An alga called Zygogonium forms these communities of mats and streamers.</p><p>Color placement within thermal water changes, in part, because temperatures and chemistry change. In a hot spring, for example, the hottest water is closest to a hot spring's vent. As the water flows outward, it gradually cools. This range of water temperature, called a thermal gradient, supports various thermophilic habitats. Chemical composition also changes as water flows from thermal features, mixes with other water sources, and is diluted or concentrated. As temperatures or chemical compositions change, microbial populations&mdash;and the colors they create&mdash;shift to a location they favor.</p><p>Some Like It Hot!</p><p>Norris Geyser Basin supports an astounding diversity of life. The majority of species here are microscopic thermophiles&mdash;heat-loving microorganisms. They survive in conditions of high heat and acidity or alkalinity that would instantly kill most other life forms.</p><p>Thermophiles are included in all three domains of life:</p><p>Bacteria This domain includes bacteria that can cause disease, fertilize soil, recycle material, and renew supplies of oxygen, nitrogen, and water. At Norris, some bacteria metabolize iron and other minerals.</p><p>Archaea The organisms in this domain were once considered bacteria, but their genes show they are as different from bacteria as they are from animals and plants. Scientists think they evolved long ago when earth's environment was much hotter. Many of the microbes in Norris are archaea.</p><p>Eukarya Within this domain are plants, animals, and fungi. Some of Norris's thermophiles&mdash;algae&mdash;also belong in this domain.</p><p>Viruses, which are not included in the three domains, also thrive in Yellowstone's hydrothermal features. The viruses here are different from other known viruses because they survive such extreme conditions.</p><p>Accessibility Information</p><p>Due to Norris Geyser Basin's rough terrain and highly changeable conditions, please expect uneven ground and steep grades that exceed 8 percent. Rocks and roots protrude into sections of dirt trail. Most of these sections are marked on the map, but may change. Proceed with extreme caution.</p><p>Geyser Basins: Windows to Earth's Interior</p><p>All of Yellowstone's hydrothermal areas are fueled by magma (molten rock) beneath the park. This magma heats water percolating down from the surface along fractures and faults. This superheated water rises back toward the surface, collecting into larger channels that serve as the &quot;plumbing&quot; for each hydrothermal feature.</p><p>Geysers form if the plumbing channel contains a constriction. Between eruptions, temperatures in the superheated, pressurized water beneath the constriction build up, creating increasing amounts of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water out of the constriction, water pressure deep in the system drops instantaneously, and the geyser erupts.</p><p>Hot springs are features with no plumbing constriction. Superheated water cools slightly as it reaches the surface, and is replaced by hotter water from deeper sources. This sets up a pattern of water circulation, which helps prevent the chain reaction leading to an eruption.</p><p>Fumaroles (steam vents) are Yellowstone's hottest surface features. Their underground channel systems penetrate the hot rock masses, but are generally dry. What little water does drain into the fumarole's plumbing converts instantly to steam.</p><p>Mudpots form when acid decomposes surrounding rock into clay. This clay mixes with water to form mud of varying consistency and color. Gases bubble and burst through the mud and create the playful plopping so characteristic of these features.</p><p>Animals at Norris</p><p>Like other hydrothermal areas in Yellowstone, Norris provides a warm respite from winter for bison and elk. They can also find plants growing here year-round and water to drink.</p><p>Watch for bison in the spring; they can seem to suddenly appear as they walk about the basin.</p><p>Elk give birth to their calves in May. Do not approach calves; adults fiercely defend their young. Bull elk in the fall are also dangerous.</p><p>Look and listen for killdeer. They nest on bare ground and will call in alarm if visitors are close by. Also look for swallows, which fly over the basin catching insects to eat.</p><p>Norris Geyser Basin is home to many insects associated with thermophiles. It also provides habitat for colorful dragonflies. Look for them in grassy areas near Crackling Lake in Porcelain Basin and Puff 'n Stuff Geyser in Back Basin. \n </p>"

  title: West Thumb Geyser Basin - Yellowstone National Park
  seo_title: west-thumb-geyser-basin-yellowstone-national-park
  sub_title: 'On the west thumb of Yellowstone Lake, this trail/boardwalk makes a loop and passes several hot springs and pools. '
  overview: "<p>Lake Facts</p><p>Elevation: 7,733 ft (2,357 m)\nArea: 131.7 sq mi (341 sq km)\nShoreline: 141 mi (227 km)\nWidth: 14 mi (23 km)\nLength: 20 mi (32 km)\nAvg depth: about 140 ft (42 m)\nMax depth: 410 ft (125 m)\nAvg summer temp: 45&deg;F (70&deg;C)</p><p>West Thumb Facts</p><p>West Thumb is a caldera within a larger caldera.\nActive hydrothermal features exist on the lake bottom here and elsewhere in the lake.</p><p>West Thumb Geyser Basin overlooks Yellowstone Lake, the largest lake at high elevation in North America. You can best appreciate its vastness in winter when the frozen surface extends as a white sheet for miles. Summer is the season to appreciate the lake's many moods. Here you can enjoy its calm, quiet mornings or witness the wind-whipped whitecaps of afternoon storms. After storms, look for rainbows arching into the wilderness beyond, a land nearly as wild as when Native Americans and explorers experienced it centuries ago.</p><p>The surface of the lake hints of what exists below. Surveys of the lake bottom in the 1990s documented hot springs and hydrothermal vents just offshore in West Thumb. Look closely&mdash;you may see their swirling patterns in the water.</p><p>Framed on the east by the Absaroka Range, the lake may be thought of as the heart of Yellowstone. Its waters are the lifeblood for a large network of plant and animal communities. Trumpeter swans and moose thrive on the aquatic growth in shallow waters along the shore. Trout are drawn to zooplankton living in these waters. Cutthroat trout are food for pelicans, otters, eagles, black and grizzly bears, and other wild life. Unfortunately, this population of cutthroat trout is now threatened by non-native lake trout.</p><p>As you walk among the basin's superheated waters, you may wonder if the lake is warmer here than elsewhere. After all, the geyser basin pours an average of 3,100 gallons (11,733 liters) of hot water into the lake every day. But even here, the lake's average summer temperature is 45&deg;F (7&deg;C).</p><p>Explosive Encounter</p><p>The large circular bay of West Thumb is an excellent example of a volcanic caldera. A powerful volcanic explosion approximately 174,000 years ago caused the earth's crust to collapse, creating the West Thumb caldera. The depression produced by the volcano later filled with water to become this large bay of Yellowstone Lake.</p><p>The West Thumb caldera lies within an even greater caldera, the Yellowstone Caldera, which is one of the world's largest and encompasses the central and southern portions of the park. Much of your visit in Yellowstone may be spent within the boundaries of this huge caldera. This larger caldera, and the lava that eventually filled it, shaped much of the present Yellowstone landscape. It resulted from a massive eruption roughly 640,000 years ago. Since that time, numerous lava flows have filled the caldera.</p><p>A Bit of History</p><p>People have long been drawn to West Thumb. Native Americans favored campsites in this area as they hunted bison in the summer. The Crow people gathered medicinal herbs here. Shoshone and Bannock peoples have stories about the formation of the lake. Early scientific expeditions, which corroborated the tales of colorful hot springs mentioned by mountain men, rested here. Visitors in the late 1890s and early 1900s appreciated a refreshing boat ride to Lake Yellowstone Hotel after several dusty days on rutted roads. The rustic log cabin near the parking lot was the original West Thumb Ranger Station built in 1925; it is one of the few such stations remaining. Now it serves as a summer visitor information station and a winter warming hut.</p><p>Water Colors</p><p>The colors you see in the pools of West Thumb are created, in part, by thermophiles (heat-loving microorganisms). Generally, green and brown indicate organisms living in cooler water, orange and yellow indicate those living in hotter water. Only a few microorganisms thrive in the springs where the temperature is close to boiling, so we see the clear, blue water. In these hot springs, the water absorbs all wavelengths of light except blue, which the pool reflects. \n </p>"

  seo_title: cascade-canyon-trail-grand-teton-national-park
  sub_title: This is an unbelievable hike up into the base of the Grand Tetons via a boat ride across Jenny Lake.
  overview: <p>This hike will bring you deep into the Teton Mountain Range.  This popular hike will start from the shore of the lake and take you up to the 200 foot tall Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point which provides great views out over the National Park.  Most people will stop at this point but this guide will take you a little further up into Cascade Canyon where you might spot a moose or two before heading back for the boat return across Jenny Lake. </p>
  tips: |-
    <p>Trailhead:
    This is located at the Jenny Lake Visitor Center.  Simply follow the signs for the Jenny Lake Boat Ramp.  You can park at the visitor center.  There is also a 3.3 mile one way trail around the lake to get to the start of the canyon trail but trust me it is worth the $10 trip via the boat across the lake to shave 6.6 miles off the hike!  </p><p>There is a $20 fee to enter the National Park as well. </p>

  sub_title: 'A hike into beautiful Garnet Canyon on the way up The Grand Teton.  This is the route most climbs of the Grand take. '
  overview: <p>This is an all day very strenuous hike up through Garnet Canyon and up to the Lower Saddle below the Grand Teton.  This is the route most climbs of the Grand take, stopping over at the Lower Saddle for rest until the next morning's climb.  This hike has an elevation gain of almost 6,000 ft. so should not be attempted by anyone not in top fitness and form.</p><p>A good alternate destination would be to just hike into Garnet Canyon with only about 2,500 ft. of elevation gain.  The views in Garnet Canyon are spectacular with the huge Teton peaks rising on three sides.  A cool stream flows along much of the canyon making a great place to eat lunch and cool your feet.</p><p>Heading up to the lower saddle requires good route finding skills and even a little climbing using a fixed rope at one point.  The variety of rock both large and small makes this canyon a rock lovers paradise.</p><p>The Lower Saddle is a very fragile alpine environment and every precaution should be taken to not step on the flowers and grasses that are hanging on in these harsh and high conditions.  Walk on the rock and look down! </p>
  tips: |-
    <p>Pack light and bring a headlamp in case you need to hike in the dark on the way back.
    Calories:  Bring a good lunch and plenty of snacks for fueling up on the trail.
    Sunscreen: You are high in the tetons and the sun in Garnet Canyon is unobstructed most of the day.
    Water: there are some good streams to get water from, so bring a couple liters of water at the start and fill up along the way.  Bring some sort of filter or purifying system. </p>

  overview: <p>Garner Cave is a rather heavily visited cave since it's close to the city. This hike is said to be on the difficult scale, and I probably wouldn't disagree. I have personally gone up there 3 times now but it's not the hardest hike I've done. </p><p>The cave has been visited by lots of people. There are a few spots that you could hurt yourself in there, but it's a pretty simple system for the most part. Don't do what you're not comfortable with doing.</p><p> </p>
  tips: <p>You'll follow the canyon all the way in. It will split into two different canyons - go left. You'll go that way for a ways (climbing over walls of rock in a few points) and then you'll come to a point where there will be a ton of shale that has slid down over the trail. At this point you want to start heading to the right which will be toward the pine trees. You'll come to a big tree in the middle of the trail (it's up a ways but you'll know you're on the right track). After this, it's about another 200ft ahead and up a bit. You'll notice the rope there to climb in.</p><p>Bring these items with you to make your life easier in the cave - knee pads, gloves, head lamps. </p><p>Good luck. </p>

  overview: "<p>R-Scape 18 hours of Ogden Race Course is about 6.2 miles long and located near Ogden, Utah. The trail is great for trail running, Mt. Biking, Hiking, dog friendly, and normally takes 1-3 hours.</p><p>The best trails, combining the upper/lower Bonneville Shoreline Trail in Ogden, designed by R-Scape, 18 hrs. of Ogden Utah. \nIf you are looking for a trail run that is both challenging and fun this is the one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been running the upper/lower Bonneville Shoreline Trail in Ogden for over 3years. Recently a friend told me about a trail race put on by R-Scape, 18 hours of Ogden. I then checked out the race course on-line. I had run both the upper and lower trails many times and though I had run every variation imaginable. I was wrong. It took me a number of runs, referencing the website (with Google earth) and reading others runner&rsquo;s blogs to get the course down. It is now one of my favorite training run in that area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The climb out of Mt. Ogden Park, through the trees, then onto the flat fire-road beneath the golf course is an excellent warm-up. Out the parking lot onto the road. Left thru the gait onto Strongs Canyon/maintenance road just before the Weber Maintenance building. A quick climb 1/4 way up the Strongs Canyon/maintenance road, quick left, over the bridge, and a very fast and engaging descent to Weber state.&nbsp; Take a right just before the Weber State bus stop. Then comes a climb, then climb, then a climb. This is where you need to dig deep if you want to get up quick. The climb eventually levels out while you follow the ridgeline with little variation in elevation. Waterfall Canyon is the first canyon you cross. Cross the bride, out again. Notice the wooden pipes wrapped in coils, always wondered the history. You will hang a left and run until just before you get to Strongs Canyon. Turn around and backtracked to where Waterfall canyon meets the trail you were just on. Take a hard left and bomb down what I believe they call &ldquo;The Bobsled&rdquo; or &quot;Luge&quot;. It is a sandy flume shaped descent that you can let loose on. You will then take a left on the trail just above the new water tower until you cross the bride at the midway point in Strongs canyon/Maintenance road. Up the new trail and loop to the right and take a left onto Strongs Canyon/maintenance road the utility road. Left on to a small trail that will then again shoot you across Strongs Canyon/maintenance road and through two iron barriers to discourage motor vehicles. Wind around staying left and you are back to the parking lot that you excited from the fire-road. Back onto the fire-road below the golf course. Back track the way you came from Mt. Ogden Park only stay to the right and follow the trail back to your starting point. Enjoy. </p>"
  tips: |-
    <p>You can Trail Run, Bike, Hike, take your dog.
    Summer: Stay hydrated. Have Fun.
    Winter: Wear some type of traction as the trail is well traveled sometimes causing a smooth and eveny icy conditions Wear something aggressive. I personally use Kahtoola MICROspikest and never have had a problem. Run at your own risk and be careful especially in waterfall canyon.  </p>

    <p>The United States Congress designated the Big Jacks Creek Wilderness in 2009 and it now has a total of 52,684 acres. All of this wilderness is located in Idaho and is managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The Big Jacks Creek Wilderness is bordered by the Little Jacks Creek Wilderness to the northwest. They are separated by a natural gas pipe line and dirt road.</p><p>
    The wilderness, in the Big Jacks Creek Basin, consists of rugged canyons, streams and plateaus that provide habitat for redband trout, mountain quail, sage hens, mountain lions, mule deer, antelope, bobcats, coyotes, and bighorn sheep, as well as two sensitive plant species. The basin ranges in elevation from 2808 to 5872 feet and drains a sagebrush-covered plateau dissected by rugged, sheer-walled canyons that are as much as 655 feet deep. Big Jacks Creek flows north into the Bruneau River, a tributary of the Snake River.</p><p>The basin is covered by big sagebrush, low sagebrush, salt desert shrub, and riparian vegetation communities. The sagebrush communities are most common; low sagebrush types are found primarily on shallow, poorly drained soil, and big sagebrush types are associated with deep, well-drained soils.</p><p>Lush riparian vegetation grows along perennial reaches of the creek and generally includes shrubs of willow, rose, and currant as well as sedge and bluegrass in meadow areas. Poison Ivy is abundant in the riparian areas. Beaver colonies are also found along the waterways.</p><p>Access to the basin is by way of a network of dirt roads in the southern part of the basin and hiking trails in the wilderness. The Parker Trail is the only mapped hiking trail into the wilderness. Other trails fall into the game/stock trail category. </p>

  overview: <p>This is a great day trip for a family.</p><p>Jordan Craters is a 27 square-mile olivine basalt lava flow that is estimated to be between 4,000 and 9,000 years old. They estimated the age by the degree of lichen growth on the rocks. There is also an 18- acre flow within the field that is estimated to be less than 100 years old. </p><p>There is one area of Jordan Craters that has vehicle access and this is Coffee Pot Crater. This crater is about two-thirds of a square mile and its considered to be a well-preserved, steep-sided crater.</p><p>The Birch Creek Ranch name encompasses two different ranches, Birch Creek Ranch and Morrison Ranch. Between the two ranches there is a total of 26 buildings or structures that are watched over by a caretaker and his wife. Some of these buildings helped this property be placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. </p><p>Birch Creek Historic Ranch serves as the primary take-out for floaters on the lower section (downstream of Rome, Oregon) of the Owyhee Wild and Scenic River. </p><p>Camping, fishing, photography, geocaching, and wildlife viewing are all pleasurable pastimes in this historic setting. There are several stock trails, suitable for hiking, leading to the canyon rim.</p><p>A five-unit campground with fire rings and picnic tables is located along the river. There is no potable water and no fee. </p>

  overview: |-
    <p>Petrified Tree: Subtropical Yellowstone
    This petrified redwood is a clue to a watmer, damper, more liolent Yellowstone landscape. Anatomically the trunk is indistinguishable from present-day redwoods in California.</p><p>When a chain of volcanoes erupted here in Eocene times 50 million years ago, they triggered massive landslides into mountain and valley streams. The rolling mix of ash, water and sand buried whole forests. Before the trees could rot, abundant silica in the volcanic flow plugged living cells, creating &quot;forests of stone.&quot;</p><p>Volcanic ash and mudflows obliterated a living landscape yet preserved this t ree for the ages. There wer three redwoods standing here before thoughtless souvenir-hunters chipped away the other two. The 1907 photograph shows a second trunk in the background (before this trunk was fenced). </p>
  tips: <p>Hydrothermal features are fragile rarities of nature. Yellowstone preserves the largest collection of hydrothermal features on the planet.

Rocks, sticks, and other objects thrown into a hydrothermal feature may be permanently cemented in place, choking off water circulation and ending all activity.</p><p>For the sake of all who follow, never throw objects into any feature. Stay on established walkways for your safety and to protect fragile formations that have formed over thousands of years.</p><p>It is illegal to collect any natural or cultural objects or to remove, deface, or destroy any plant, animal, or mineral in Yellowstone's hydrothermal areas. Bring drinking water; take out all trash.</p><p>While viewing or photographing the area, protect your camera, glasses, and binocular lenses from hydrothermal heat and stray.</p><p>Toxic gases exist in Yellowstone. Dangerous levels of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide have been measured in some hydrothermal areas. If you feel sick, leave the location immediately.</p><p>Help preserve Yellowstone for the future. </p>

  seo_title: tower-fall-overlook-yellowstone-national-park
  sub_title: Tower Fall is a 132-foot waterfall in the Tower-Roosevelt region of Yellowstone National Park.
  overview: <p>This popular waterfall on Tower Creek was named by members of the 1870 Washburn expedition. It first was called &quot;Minaret Creek,&quot; but one member objected, stating that the name violated their agreement to naming objects for their friends. He claimed the name was in reference to &quot;Minnie Rhett,&quot; a sweetheart of one of the other members. By unanimous vote, the name was reconsidered and the names &quot;Tower Creek&quot; and &quot;Tower Falls&quot; were applied.</p><p>The 132-foot waterfall plunges as a near-perfect water column until it crashes onto the rocks at its base. Until 1986, a precarious boulder was perched on the lip of the falls, and in the spring of that year, without witnesses, it plunged to the bottom. Tower Creek has cut through the basalt formation, which make up the walls of the gorge. At the brink of the falls are eerie-shaped minarets or towers sculpted from rhyolitic basalt. </p>

  overview: <p>Yellowstone River Overlook, also called Calcite Springs Overlook Trail, is a short, easy loop walk that leads to a platform overlooking the Yellowstone River. Layers of basalt columns and thermal springs along the river's edge are also visible. The area was named by USGS geologist Arnold Hague in 1885, but the name was based on previous usage. The constriction in the river is called &quot;The Narrows.&quot; Early explorers discovered the sulphur to be &quot;pure enough to burn readily when ignited.&quot; Research conducted during the 1930s found the springs to have the highest percentage of hydrogen sulfide gas as well as deposits of calcite and gypsum. Calcite Springs is the lowest elevation of any hot area in the park.</p><p>The east wall of the Grand Canyon, facing the overlook, is a cross-section of layers of glacial drift resting on lake deposits and columnar basalt. The haxagonal columns of basalt are caused by cooling, shrinking and cracking of several basaltic flows. </p>
  tips: <p>Take time to walk the whole loop.</p>

  overview: <p>&quot;The Beaten Path&quot; is a 25 mile trail traversing some of the most spectacular country within the 944,000 acre Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness.  Lakes and streams appear around just about every corner enticing both those appreciative of a spectacular Wilderness view or one with a penchant for hooking a trout upon the end of their fly-line.  </p><p>The trail itself is aptly-titled &quot;The Beaten Path&quot; for it is literally a well-worn treadway stretching from Cooke City in the South to East Rosebud in the North.  Signage is ample and the route is easy-to-follow during the summer season (July - early September).  For the more adventurous, ample opportunities to leave the trail and find true Wilderness lie up every draw you see.  </p><p>The Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness is part of the greater Yellowstone ecosystem and spans 944,000 acres of Montana and Wyoming. The two access points to &quot;The Beaten Path&quot; are at East Rosebud Trailhead (about 15 miles from Roscoe, Montana) and the Clark Fork Trailhead (a couple miles East of Cooke City, Montana).  You'll find primitive car camping options at both ends of the trail so arriving in the evening and car camping before an early departure into the backcountry is an option.  </p><p>The trail rises in elevation to a high point and then descends so hiking North from Cooke City or South from Ease Rosebud are both options.  Viewing the elevation profile will provide you a better understanding and will help you decide which direction is best for you.  The trail is approximately 25 miles long and passes through a number of ecosystems.  Although it has been hiked in a single day many times the beauty of the scenery and possibility for off-trail exploration may cause you to opt to spend a few days along the path.  Consider shorter days and spend the extra time fishing or bagging a peak. </p>
  tips: <p>Considerations should be made when planning your hike regarding a few points.  The trail passes through high elevation alpine terrain which holds snow into the month of July which can make the terrain difficult to pass for some hikers.  The elevation will also cause people from lower elevations to be out of breath.  If either of these considerations concern you be certain to plan your itinerary accordingly.  The Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness is located in grizzly bear country and special planning must be undertaken to avoid conflicts with bears and well as to provide safety to yourself and the wildlife. </p>

    From Amidon, travel two miles east on Highway 85 and make a right onto an unmarked gravel road. Proceed five miles (mark your odometer) and make a right onto another unmarked dirt road. Continue 1.2 miles to what appears to be a residence. A large metal mailbox is on the left.  It is custom to leave a donation in this mailbox as you are traveling over their land. A tractor road begins at this mailbox and heads directly toward White Butte.  This road can be crazy rutty so it's your choice whether or not you want to drive to the actual trail or not.   </p>

  seo_title: north-umpqua-river-valley
  sub_title: Collection of hikes along the North Fork of the Umpqua River.
  overview: <p>The North Umpqua River is a tributary of the Umpqua River, approximately 100 miles long. It drains a scenic and rugged area of the Cascade Range southwest of Eugene, flowing through steep canyons and surrounded by large Douglas-fir forests. Renowned for its emerald green waters, it is considered one of the best fly fishing streams in the Northwest for anadromous fish.</p><p>It rises in the high Cascades, issuing from Maidu Lake at elevation of 5,980 feet in the Mount Thielsen Wilderness, along the Douglas-Klamath county line approximately 70 miles east of Roseburg. It follows a serpentine course down from the Cascades, westward along the southern side of the Calapooya Mountains. Its upper course passes through the Umpqua National Forest, past Toketee Falls and Steamboat, where it receives Steamboat Creek from the north. It receives the Little River from the south at Glide and joins the South Umpqua from the east approximately 5 miles northwest of Roseburg to form the Umpqua.</p><p>It is impounded in its upper reaches in the Cascades to form Lemolo Lake for hydroelectricity. It is also impounded for hydroelectricity at Soda Springs Dam, forming a small reservoir on the upper river.</p><p>The river's reputation as a world-class steelhead stream and its famous emerald waters are a result of the fact the river source is high enough in the Cascades to derive from snowmelt during the entire year. The melting snow is trapped in volcanic soil and pumice and released during the summer months, providing an even cool-temperature flow. During the summer the flow of the river is approximately 20 times that of the nearby South Umpqua. In its lower reaches, the river's flow becomes increasingly erratic, in a manner typical of mountain streams of the region.</p><p>The region around the river has long been a timber-producing area. Starting in 1955, the watershed of the river was extensively clear cut, a practice which continued until 1969 when forestry management practices were changed. During this period many tributary streambeds were used as impromptu logging roads. The recovery of the river from these practices has been closely monitored by state and federal agencies </p>
  tips: <p>OR 138 leaves Roseburg on the North Umpqua Highway No. 138 as it follows the Umpqua River's north fork. It heads due east out of Roseburg, ascending into the Cascade mountains, and turning northeast. Eventually, the highway turns south and reaches Diamond Lake, passing by the lake to the east. Just south of there is an intersection with Oregon Route 230, which bypass Crater Lake National Park to the west. South of there lies the north entrance to the park. OR 138 continues east from the entrance, descending into Central Oregon, and terminates at an intersection with U.S. Route 97 at Diamond Lake Junction, south of the town of Chemult.</p><p>The portion of the highway between Roseburg and Diamond Lake is part of the Rogue-Umpqua Scenic Byway. The portion between former Route 209 and US 97 is part of the Volcanic Legacy Scenic Byway. </p>

  seo_title: toketee-falls
  sub_title: Beautiful waterfall over basalt cliffs into a wave-tossed pool.
  overview: <p>Toketee Falls is one of the most famous waterfalls in all of Oregon, renowned far and wide for the graceful columnar basalt formation framing the two-stepped falls. The North Umpqua River has carved a sinuous gorge out of the lava flow, resulting in a waterfall of 113 feet in height - a 28 foot upper tier which plunges into a pool flanked by a deep alcove, followed by an 85 foot plunge into a large pool. </p><p>At the trailhead, the wooden 12 foot diameter Toketee Pipeline is passed, which diverts much of the volume of the North Umpqua River to a powerhouse downstream. This artificial taming of the river allows the waterfall to flow in an extremely consistent manor all year long.</p><p> </p>
  tips: <p>To get here take Hwy 138 east of Roseburg.  Between milepost 58 and 59 turn north on Toketee-Rigdon road 34.  Keep left at all road junctions to the parking ara. </p>

  sub_title: Via Diamond Lake and Southeast Ridge with optional ski descent
  overview: <p>A fairly easy ski ascent and descent of a fun peak near Crater Lake.  This ascent follows snowmobile tracks for a good portion before heading into the woods and then finally up a southeast ridge to the bare summit.  Cat ski operations are on this mountain so you may see other skiers but you'll know that you're more of a man/woman for earning your turns than the people who get their butts escorted to the top...  At the top you'll have an awesome view of Mt. Thielsen over Diamond Lake. </p>
  tips: <p>From route 138 turn onto Route 230 near Diamond Lake and continue down the road until the first road on your right.  There will be a small parking lot most likely filled with snowmobile trailers.  This is your start.  A Snow permit or Northwest Forest Pass is needed here.  Also, if you were smart enough to buy a couple 6-packs of beer you may be able to trade them for a tow in or tow out... keep that in mind. </p>

  seo_title: mt-thielsen-standard-summit-route-and-ski-descent
  sub_title: Via the PCT and the West Ridge with a truly unbelievable ski descent back to your vehicle
  overview: <p>This is a fantastic ski mountaineering trip.  One of the few where you can ski directly back to your vehicle without much pushing involved with your poles.  It was winter so the gps track here follows the actual trail very well but may be a couple hundred feet off from the trail on the ascent.  On the descent we went wherever the good snow was but kept close to our ascent track to return directly to our car.   The summit is about an 80 foot steep spire that is not advisable to climb if there is snow and ice without a rope.  It's got a ton of exposure and a fall would be deadly.  When you get to the base of it, you'll see that it is not skiable anyway.  Near the top be aware that there will be cornices so stay away from any edges. </p>
  tips: <p>The trailhead is directly across the street from Diamond Lake off of Route 138.  You will need a Northwest Forest Pass to park here. </p>

For perhaps years afterward, hot gas moved to the surface and slowly cemented ash and pumice together in channels and escaped through fumaroles. Erosion later removed most of the surrounding loose ash and pumice, leaving tall pinnacles and spires. </p>

  overview: |-
    <p>From the hillside, you can see the Luckiamute River flowing east in the valley below. The Luckiamute Band of Kalapuya Indians once maintained a village on the valley floor. They were one of the many linguistically and culturally related bands of people collectively known as the Kalapuya who occupied the Willamette Valley.</p><p>The Kalapuya intensively managed the landscape, setting fires that encouraged growth of food plants (camas, tarweed, white oak) and plants used for baskets, mats, and various tools (hazel, rushes, bear grass). Burning also
    provided better forage for game animals, better hunting areas, travel routes and the lower fuel loads guarded against catastrophic wild fires.</p><p>A party of 25 people led by Nahum King settled in Kings Valley in 1846 after crossing the Oregon Trail. Here the settlers found open prairies and oak groves the Kalapuya had managed for thousands of years. The homesteaders
    took full advantage of this lush oak-savanna habitat, quickly converting the flood plain and foothill prairies to crop production and pasturage, while taking fuel, lumber, and wild game from the timbered uplands. </p><p>&ldquo;The water is all soft as it is in Massachusetts. Soda springs are common and fresh water springs without number. . . There are thousands of. . . berries. It is an easy place to make a living. You can raise as many cattle as you please and not cost you a cent, for the grass is green the whole winter. . . .&rdquo; &mdash; Anna Maria King, 1846</p><p>The U.S. Army established Fort Hoskins in 1856 atop the bench below to monitor traffic entering and leaving the newly established Coast (Siletz)Indian Reservation to the west. Located at the crossroads of two major trails,
    the fort quickly became a regional center of economic and political activity.</p><p>When the Civil War ended, Samuel and Mary Frantz purchased the decommissioned fort property, built the house that still stands on the east side of the park, and replaced the barracks with barns, a blacksmith shop, and other farm
    structures.</p><p>A long-term oak savanna restoration project dominates the hillside above the overlook. By removing young Douglas fir
    trees, reintroducing native plants, and using periodic fire management, Benton County is reestablishing the habitat familiar to the Kalapuya, the soldiers at
    Fort Hoskins, and the early Kings Valley pioneers.</p><p> </p>

  sub_title: Jedediah Smith Redwoods SP
  overview: <p>The Boy Scout Trail ranks as one of the top showcases of old-growth redwood forests in existence with truly huge trees and several distinct redwood forest types. Part of the beauty of Jedediah Smith Redwoods is that it is the single least developed and most pristine old-growth forest around.</p><p>The Boy Scout Trail has an honest feel of remoteness to it, with  not a whisper of modern sounds to be heard. Catch this trail on a sunny morning and the filtered slanting rays reveal a stunning variety of textures and color variations on the redwood's bark. In the fogs of this region, the sense of mystery becomes astounding.</p><p>This is an out-and-back hike and unlike other hikes, both directions are amazing, revealing a constant supply of sights you may have missed on the way in. It's really a toss-up over which direction is better.</p><p>The trip to the trail head is an adventure as you walk through a magnificent old&ndash;growth grove on Howland Hill Road. Much of the route is on an old dirt logging road that's kept well graded. If you've never toured on logging roads, you should absolutely do it! There's a visceral something totally lacking on paved roads. This one's easily passable in 2WD. </p><p>At the trailhead, located in a spectacular redwood grove, there's a little pullout that can accommodate about six cars. </p>
  tips: "<p>Managed cooperatively by the National Park Service and California State Parks, the park has about 20 miles of hiking and nature trails, river access on the Smith River and Mill Creek, and visitor center.</p><p>Location/ Directions\n1440 Highway 199\nCrescent City, CA 95531</p><p>Nine miles east of Crescent City on Highway 199.\nLatitude/Longitude: 41.7817 / -124.1008 </p><p>Telephone\n707-458-3018\n707-464-6101 </p><p>Operating Hours\nDay use sunrise to sunset.

  sub_title: Fern Canyon at Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park
  overview: '<p>Fern Canyon is a surrealistic and amazing display of primal ferns growing in a narrow 50-foot-deep vertical walled canyon. The floor is nearly all creek bed which helps provide a contrast of water, gravel, stumps and downed trunks.</p><p>All of the park staff I spoke to said that this walk was at the top of their list for places to visit at Prairie Creek SP. It''s also considered one of the most amazing spots along the North Coast!</p><p>Fern Canyon was used for several scenes in the movie Jurassic Park 2: Lost Worlds (1997) and the BBC series Walking with Dinosaurs (2000) for very good reason. Try and watch these before coming out, especially if you''re bringing kids. </p><p>The rest of this short loop walk climbs out and along the slopes above the grotto through the surrounding forests.</p><p>Expect slow going in the canyon.  At least 5 species of fern and dozens of other plant species create an overload of color, shape, and texture. </p><p>Add to the sensory mix a combination of light climbing over logs, ankle deep creek crossings, little animal surprises (amphibians and in one spot, millions of centipedes), a total lack of modern sounds (if it''s not a busy day), birds, insect noises, the breeze through the trees...overall, it is an amazing experience.</p><p>Drive or hike in. Hiking will make a day trip of it or if you prefer to spend the weekend, there are a number of camping options,  </p><p>Driving in to the park is a small adventure in itself. The road in is largely unpaved but is suitable for 2 w/d cars. These old dirt roads provide a far better visceral experience than paved streets in these forests. But be careful - the road can be narrow and has plenty of blind curves.</p><p>The final leg of the road traces the coast between the narrow coastal plains and bluffs. It provides access to beach camping and several additional trail heads. Expect 2 or 3 shallow creek crossings on the way in to the canyon.</p><p>The park is designated as a World Heritage Site and International Biosphere Reserve.</p><p>The park''s tree cover primarily consists of old-growth coast redwood, hemlock and Douglas fir. Sitka spruce and Red Alder provide additional forest cover. </p><p>Because of frequent coastal fogs, the forest understory vegetation can get very lush and dense. Tan oaks, cascara, maples and California bay can be found on edges and grassland spaces. Western azalea and rhododendron bloom in May and June and offer bright accents and pops of color to the dense green of the forest. </p>'

  sub_title: A Portion of the California Coastal Trail at Humboldt Lagoons SP
  overview: "<p>Tucked away along the isolated coast of Del Norte County between the villages of Trinidad and Orick lies the largest lagoon system in the continental United States. This hike will explore Sharp Point separating Stone Lagoon to the north and Dry Lagoon to the south. It's a segment of the California Coastal Trail, hosts a paddle-in campground and supports a number of vegetation communities.</p><p>About the lagoons: \nThe lagoons are shallow, landlocked bodies of water along the coast which are separated from the sea by coastal spits of land. Seawater only flows in and out of the lagoons when it breaks through the spits, generally during winter storm seasons.</p><p>In the early 1900's, Dry Lagoon was drained by early farmers  in an attempt to grow several types of crops, none of which proved economically viable. Today, Dry Lagoon supports a wetland environment that attracts migratory birds. Additionally, several dairy ranches were established along the shores of Stone Lagoon. </p><p>At Stone Lagoon the park&rsquo;s visitor center on HWY 101 was formerly a local motel-restaurant called the &quot;Little Red Hen.&quot; This business operated until 1979. Today the restaurant has been remodeled into a museum/bookstore and the park office. Picnic tables, restrooms, and boat launching are all available here. </p><p>Plant Life: \nThe coastal beaches within Humboldt Lagoons support healthy coastal dune vegetation. The edges of both Big and Stone lagoons contain brackish marshes; Dry Lagoon supports both freshwater and a brackish marsh. The landlocked Freshwater Lagoon is surrounded by a narrow strip of freshwater marshlands.</p><p>In the park's forests are Coast Redwood, Sitka Spruce, Western Hemlock, Fir, Red Alder and large stands of Willows.</p><p>Wildlife:\nHumboldt Lagoons is part of the Pacific Flyway, hosting more than 200 bird species which include: bald eagles, peregrine falcons and threatened Western snowy plovers. Black bear, Roosevelt elk herds and bobcats can be seen throughout the park. Offshore, whales, dolphins and sea lions can be encountered.</p><p>The lagoons are open for fishing and exploration by boat; primarily small power boats, canoes, kayaks, paddle-boards, and even shallow keeled sailboats. Kayak Zak&rsquo;s, a local vendor who's super helpful and friendly, provides kayak rentals and tours.</p><p>Along the beaches we have access to six miles of both bird and whale watching.</p><p>The local supporting Non-Profit:\nNorth Coast Redwood Interpretive Association\nPatrick&rsquo;s Point State Park\n4150 Patrick&rsquo;s Point Drive\nTrinidad.

  overview: <p>Tall Trees Trail is about 4 miles long and located near Orick, California in Redwoods National Park. The trail is great for hiking and normally takes a half day.</p><p>Nice hike through a pretty remote part of Redwood NP. To gain access to the trailhead you need to stop by the Kuchel visitor center on the coast to get a pass and the combination to the lock on the access gate. It is about 7 miles up to the gate from 101 and about 6 miles down to the trailhead from the gate. The little extra effort is worth it. There was absolutely no one on the trail or access road. The trail runs gently down to the Redwood River through some amazing groves of huge trees. It is about 1.5 miles down, then there is a 1 mile flat loop at the bottom with really interesting flora along with more huge trees. </p>
  tips: <p>Get the pass from the visitor center. Be prepared for a 6 mile dirt road down to the trailhead from the gate. </p>

  sub_title: ''
  overview: <p>Table Rock is at 4881 feet, offers some incredible views of the Cascades. Here is my track from July 2, 2011. Just under 8 miles and 2900 feet of elevation gained, some of which was goofing around some of the different rock outcroppings. The first 1.5 miles of the hike are on an old logging road,You will come to a landslide that wiped out part of the road, just work your way around it up through the trees and then work your way back down to the road. Go about another mile and keep your eyes open for the old trail on your right, its usually marked with rock piles. Once you are on this trail your next turn will be at the saddle, you can turn left to go to Table Rock or right to go out to Rooster rock. Be sure to be prepared for weather conditions, there was still some lingering snow to deal with on the North side and in some of the shady pockets, makes for some fun route finding... The trails are marked occasionally with ribbon and even some old blazes on the trees to help find the way if the snow covers the trail. </p>
  tips: <p>From the town of Molalla take highway 211 East, follow the signs to Frier Park 1.96 miles. Cross the Molalla River at Frier Park and turn right in Dickie Prairie Rd 1.6 miles, turn right at the Dickie Prairie store and go about 3.5 miles to the Glen Avon Bridge turn right. Follow the Molalla River 13 miles and you will start seeing signs for Table Rock trailhead turn left on to road 7-3E-14. Stay on this road for another 2.5 miles and take a right on to road 7-3E-7. That was your last turn, just 4 more miles to the trailhead. </p>

You can hike up the slope a bit further to POI #3 if you would like a view over Mirror Lake but I only suggest doing this in summer time as in the winter that slope is prone to avalanche.  Bring a camera and hope for calm winds as you will see a great reflection of the volcanoe in the lake. </p>'
  tips: <p>Drive east on Rte. 26 from Portland.  Follow signs for Mt. Hood and the ski resorts.  The parking lot for the trailhead is on the last tight bend of the highway before it reaches Government Camp.  In the winter you'll want a snow park pass and in the summer you'll want a Northwest Forest Pass. </p>

  overview: <p>The trail meanders through young Douglas-fir and Western Hemlock forest. The trail ends at Henline Falls. Here you will find remnants of old mining from the 1930's. A mine adit was built into the solid rock wall and goes back in about 1500 feet.</p><p>However, recently it has been gated off at about 100 feet, which is disappointing.  Would be fun to explore further back into the dark.</p><p>Another thing to note, the mine is a bit difficult to get up to for little kids, and they will need a hand so they don't fall especially if the rock is wet (not really that dangerous just be careful) </p>

  tips: <p>At 5277' the snow should be gone by late July most years, but you should always be prepared. In August the huckleberries should be available making for a nice trailside snack.

  overview: <p>From the Oregon State Parks Website:</p><p>Nestled in the lower elevation of Oregon's Cascade Mountains lies a temperate rain forest. It is here that the Trail of Ten Falls/Canyon Trail can be found. The Canyon Trail and the falls descend to a forest floor covered with ferns, mosses, and wildflowers. You will also find stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, and cedar. While thousands visit the park every year, it is large enough for you to find quiet places to sit and watch for birds (download a bird list as a text file.)</p><p>The Canyon Trail is a nationally recognized trail system that leads hikers along the banks of the north and south forks of Silver Creek. It takes you to 10 majestic waterfalls, ranging from the grand South Falls (177 feet), to the delicate Drake Falls (27 feet). Four of these falls have an amphitheater-like surrounding where you can walk behind the falls and feel the misty, crisp spray. </p>
  tips: <p>Best time to visit is Springtime when the falls are at high flow and the terrain is sturdy. </p><p>No pooches allowed on the lower canyon trail. </p><p>There's a lot more to explore than just waterfalls like the historic ranches and cabins! </p>

There are plenty of benches to rest at and the trail is extremely well maintained, perfect for the whole family.  Before or after the amazing hike you can even enjoy some great coffee and food at the cafe and gift shop located next to the parking lot.  The park itself is 9,000 acres and contains over 24 miles of trails for biking and hiking but this trail is by far the best of all of them.  Definitely one of my favorite easy hikes in all of Oregon! </p>
  tips: <p>Day use permits are required year round and as of this writing cost $5 with an annual pass costing $30.  Pets are allowed in the park and the picnic areas but are not allowed on the Canyon Trail of Ten Falls.  The park is open year round.  From my experience in the dryiest months of August and September the waterfalls lose much of their water but in the spring months and rainy winter months the falls are powerful but you might get wet on the walk.  I've tried to include photos of high flow and low flow times of year so you can get an idea of what the best time to go is. </p>

  seo_title: medicine-lake-volcano-mount-hoffman-standard-summit-route
  sub_title: Via Forest Service Roads and attached GPS track with optional ski descent
  overview: <p>This was a LONG, LONG ski ascent and descent.  I would suggest doing this trip in the summer if you are looking to bag the highest point of the Medicine Lake Volcano.  I have it in my head that I want to ski all the cascade volcanoes so we went in with skins on for this long trek over mostly low-incline terrain.   You have the ability when the forest service roads are clear of snow of significantly cutting down the mileage of this trip.  We had to stop a couple miles past the Door Knob Snowmobile Park which cut off a little bit of road but not enough for our liking.  Because we wanted to ski this, we went in with skins on which was slow going for the nearly 7 miles to the top mostly following on the roads covered with snow.  At about 6,600 feet we left the road and made a bee-line for the high point.  There are not many views on this trip, except for the very top which gives you a view down towards Medicine Lake.   The trip out isn't steep enough, especially in sticky wet snow, to have much fun skiing out.  We left our skins off and our heels free to make it a bit easier.  It is technically easy but difficult because of the long mileage and flat terrain within trees. </p>
  tips: <p>From Lava Beds National Monument on Hill Road take USFS 47 N 75 from where it departs Hill Road near Hippo and Crescent Butte.  Follow this road until you come to USFS 44 N 32 and follow that as far as snow permits. </p>

  sub_title: A stroll over the surface of the moon on volcanic glass from the Newberry Crater
  overview: <p>There are few places in the continental United States where you can walk in a landscape so utterly foreign. The Big Obsidian Flow is a patch of black and grey volcanic glass covering about 4 square miles of the Newberry Crater floor. You can expect to see everything from the classic jet-black glass suited for Native American tools to frothy grey glass that looks more like a stone sponge than an arrowhead. </p><p>Throughout the flow, there are interpretive signs telling the history of the area, from the eruption 1300 years ago, to the colonization of plants and animals, to the use of the glass by native tribes and its trade throughout the west. </p>
  tips: <p>The obsidian shards can be as sharp as a scalpel, so be sure to watch your footing and your handholds. This might not be a hike for young children or dogs, and it's certainly not one for flipflops.</p><p>There is NO shade on this hike, so be sure to bring water in the summer as the temps can get pretty high in the middle of all this black volcanic glass. </p>

The sun rises in the east illuminating all of the volcanic rock spires of the peak and the Sisters Volcano Complex to the West.  It is one of the most beautiful sights I've seen in Oregon.  There are plenty of campground spots along the lakes where you can spend the night in preparation for a very early rise to do this trip.  Less than a mile up the road I've also included a gps track of a hiking trail that will bring you to the top as well.

Keep an eye on the gps track to figure out where best to head into the woods.  This is your choice but the track does follow an easy route through the trees for those with skis on.  You may be able to find a snowmobile track to follow higher up on the ridgeline.  Follow the ridge all the way to the summit.  From the summit you have a bunch of ski options.  You can tackle the steep face back down to the bowl below or traverse back along the ridge for a safer route through the trees.  We did the latter as the snow conditions didn't seem to safe.  If all is good I would suggest skiing down the bowl then traversing skiers right to re-join the ridge for the descent. </p>

  title: Diamond Peak Standard Summit Route
  seo_title: diamond-peak-standard-summit-route
  sub_title: Via Corrigan Lake and the Northwest Ridge with optional ski descent
  overview: <p>This is a truly amazing ski descent on a less traveled Oregon Volcano.  The Ascent is straightforward through the trees.  The GPS track in this guide does not follow the trail which at the time was buried under feet of snow.  It was however the most direct and easy ski ascent.  When you get to 7,000 feet you'll you have the choice of going left or right around what looks above to be the summit.  We chose right which led us to a steep ridge and a couple tricky traverses across steep snow slopes.  The other choice would be to go to the left around which is a little longer but far easier and will also serve as your ski descent route.  There are lots of ski options in this trip for all abilities but as usual make sure the snow conditions are safe. </p>
  tips: <p>From Oakridge drive south on Highway 58 a mile and turn right onto Forest Service Road 21 (Rigdon Road).  This road makes a right in a half mile following along the Hills Creek Reservoir.  Continue on this road for a long 30 miles to Forest Service Road 2149.  Take a left onto this road and follow it as far as you can or until you reach the Corrigan Lake Trail at 5 miles. </p>

  sub_title: An easy 2-mile trek to the lake with great camping options
  overview: <p>Off of the Waldo Highway, this is an easy trek around 2 miles to the lake. It is great lake to take a casual hike to.  This is a good trip for a two day camping excursion.. You can hike around the lake. The Pacific Crest Trail follows along the North side of the lake. There is a trail on the South side of the lake but it is not in the best condition. There is also a large Rock outcrop you will need to negotiate on the West side. </p><p>To get to the Trailhead from Eugene, take I5 South to Oregon State Highway 58 going east.  You will pass by Lowell lake, Lookout Resevior, Oakridge (35 miles from I5)  15 miles east of Oakridge take a left onto Waldo Lake Road (#5897) About 5 miles up the road on the right is the Bobby Trailhead sign. </p>
  tips: <p>I believe the best time to hike to this lake is mid August to September.  Anytime before this, you will be inundated with Mosquitoes. I would still bring plenty of bug juice just in case. </p>

The surf churns, foams, and swirls as it mixes a violent brew. The punch bowl was probably created by the collapse of the roof over two sea caves, then shaped by wave action. </p><p>The park is a popular whale watching site and displays an intriguing geology.

  title: Mt. Washington Standard Summit Route
  seo_title: mt-washington-standard-summit-route
  sub_title: Via Big Lake and North Ridge
  overview: <p>This is a technical mountain like Three Fingered Jack to the north that requires rock climbing and mountaineering skills.  There is extreme exposure so it is not for people with fears of heights.  You will approach the mountain via the PCT and then follow a steep climbers trail to the north ridge which you will follow to the final summit block.  Once you get to the saddle beneath the summit block parties will rope up and continue up the Class 4-5 crumbly rock over several pitches.  The first 75 feet to the top of the &quot;the nose&quot; is often considered the most difficult in the climb.  Keep an eye out for rockfall.  Once on top, enjoy the views north of TFJ and Jefferson and south to the Sisters and Broken Top.  Most parties will rappel down from the top.  There are plenty of anchors around and many have lashing on them already but it is always wise to use your own gear as you don't know how long that has been up there.  Take your time and stay safe! </p>
  tips: <p>The trailhead is located down the road from the Hoodoo Ski Resort.  Take forest road 2690 south two miles to Big Lake.   Just before the lake turn left onto the old Santiam Wagon Road (Forrest Service 500).  In about half a mile you'll reach the intersection with the PCT.  Start here.  Use the GPS track to find the climbers trail off the PCT. </p>

  seo_title: three-fingered-jack-standard-summit-route
  sub_title: Via PCT and South Ridge
  overview: <p>This is an advanced mountaineering climb with vertical walls at the top and very poor rock.  You absolutely MUST have rock climbing and mountaineering skills and the relative gear to make this ascent.  From the parking, follow the PCT to nearly the western face of the mountain.  Look for a cairn marking the climbers route and follow it up to the summit pinnacles where you will need to clip into bolts in the rock.  You and your partner will belay each other for the rest of the trip and most likely rappel down from the summit which is a very narrow ridge only about a foot wide with over thousand foot drops on either side.  If you have any fear of heights whatsoever do not attempt this climb.  Again, you must have prior experience leading climbs to attempt this. </p>
  tips: <p>Start at the parking lot opposite of the Hoodoo road off of Route 20 in Santiam Pass.  A Northwest Forest Pass is required for this parking lot. </p>

  title: Clear Lake Trail
  seo_title: clear-lake-trail
  sub_title: 'This hiking trail loops all the way around Clear Lake along the scenic McKenzie Highway in Oregon. '
  overview: <p>Clear Lake, the &quot;lake born of fire&quot;, is the headwaters of the McKenzie River and was formed 3000 years ago when lava from Sand Mountain reached the river and backed up water to form the lake.</p><p>The original forest that had lined the river banks was submerged. Remnants of some of these submerged trees still stand under 120 feet of water and are visible from the trail and by boat. The nearly freezing temperature of the lake makes it unsuitable for swimming.</p><p>Osprey and bald eagles, and native cutthroat trout call the lake home. Non-native rainbow and brook trout are also found in the lake.</p><p>Clear Lake is popular for fishing, canoeing and boating. No motors are allowed on the lake. The Clear Lake Loop Trail is open to both hikers and mountain bikes. </p>
  tips: <p>You will find Clear Lake on Hwy 126 3 miles south of the Hwy 20/126 junction.  If coming from Eugene/Springfield go roughly 64 miles East of Springfield (18 miles east of McKenzie Bridge)on Hwy 126.</p><p>From Portland/Salem take the Detroit Lakes Hwy 22 roughly 80 miles to the Santiam Junction. Go west on Hwy 20 for 3.5 miles and turn left on Hwy 126 for 3 miles.</p><p>Make sure you bring plenty of water and sun block lotion, as some of the trail goes through lava fields where the sun can get very hot. </p>

  overview: <p>Sahalie Falls and Koosah Falls are located on the old &quot;Clear Lake Cutoff&quot; section of Highway 126. These falls mark the terminus of two thick flows of basaltic andesite lava that dammed Clear Lake and moved into the McKenzie River 3,000 years ago. The results are two breathtaking waterfalls with foaming white water cascades in between. </p><p>Sahalie (or &quot;Heaven&quot;) and Koosah (or &quot;Sky&quot;) are Chinook Jargon words - part of a rudimentary trade language that allowed people to exchange news and goods in the area. The Kalapuya, Molalla, Sahaptain and Chinook peoples traveled and traded here, perhaps on their way to obtain obsidian in the high Cascades or to gather huckleberries.</p><p>A loop trail connects the two waterfalls, and the McKenzie River National Recreation Trail, and offers up close views of the wild McKenzie River.</p><p>Both sites feature parking area, interpretive panels that tell the story of area geology, restrooms and observation points.</p><p>Sahalie Falls Viewpoint is fully accessible. </p>
  tips: <p>17 miles northeast of McKenzie Bridge. To access Koosah Falls Day Use Area, from McKenzie Bridge travel east on Hwy 126 approximately 17.3 miles. Turn left at the Ice Cap Campground/Koosah Falls sign. To access Sahalie Falls Day Use Area, proceed another 1/2 mile north of the Koosah Falls turnoff on Hwy 126. The parking area is located on the left. </p>

  overview: <p>Duffy Lake &amp; Red Butte is about 12.7 miles long and located near Marion Forks, Oregon. The trail is great for hiking and normally takes a full day.</p><p>Trail up to Duffy Lake is pretty easy, with one stream crossing that was simple as well, although I hear at times it can get a bit deep in early spring.View at Duffy Lake is amazing, the water is a bit cold but great to swim in (I'm guessing perfect temp wise by August).&nbsp; We camped on the West end of the lake and had a choice view of Three Fingered Jack.&nbsp; We did a bit of fishing and caught and released some German Brown trout.The mosquito's were hell at the campground.&nbsp; This has been a late snow melt off year so I'm guessing the mosquito level is what you would normally find in late June.&nbsp; Make sure you have repellent.The next day we hiked up to Duffy Butte.&nbsp; There isn't a trail so you will have to scramble up yourself.&nbsp; From the top you get amazing views of Three Fingered Jack, Mt. Jefferson, Mt. Washington, North &amp; Middle Sister, and Broken Top.We scrambled back down and ate some lunch before taking off for Mowich Lake and to summit Red Butte.&nbsp; The hike is through a 2003 forest fire so bring pleanty of sunscreen and lots of water.Just before the trailess scramble up to Red Butte you will come across little Alice Lake.&nbsp; A good place to water up before heading up.&nbsp; Really nice views of the same mountains I mentioned before as well as Jorn Lake and the 8 Lake Basin to the North.Overall great backpacking trip. </p>
  tips: <p>To get here drive 76 miles east of Salem on Hwy 22 (or 6 miles north of the Santiam &quot;Y,&quot;) the turnoff for the trailhead is to the East Big Meadows Road 2267 for about 3 miles and follow a sign to the left when the pavement ends. A turnaround loop is at the end of the road. This is a fee-use area for parking.

  sub_title: Hike this short section of the McKenzie River Trail to the beautiful Tamolitch (Blue Pool)
  overview: <p>The McKenzie River trail is twenty six miles long and runs from Clear Lake to McKenzie Bridge.  It's world famous for Mountain Bikers, and very nice for hikers as well.</p><p>This short portion of the trail takes you to the beautiful turquoise Tamolitch Pool, also known as Blue Pool.</p><p>Beginning of this easy hike is through old growth Douglas fir forest.  As the McKenzie river falls away you walk along the cliff.  Eventually you come upon an old lava flow.  </p><p>At Blue Pool you can scamper down the steep embankment and go for a VERY chilly swim.  This pool is actually where the McKenzie river comes back up after being underground just after Carmen Reservoir.  It's known as a dry falls, because during especially wet rainy winters the river will flood over the lava bed and waterfall into Tamolitch. </p>
  tips: <p>To get here take the McKenzie Hwy 126 14 miles east of McKenzie Bridge.  If you are coming from the Hwy 20 junction it's about 10 miles past south of the junction.  Turn at the Trailbridge Campground sign, you will cross a bridge and quickly turn right onto a gravel road. After about a third of a mile park at the signs for the trail crossing.</p><p>Bring your hiking shoes or bring your bike.  The McKenzie River trail is shared by hikers and mountain bikers alike so respect each other.</p><p>Bring a swim suit if you want a very cold dip in the pool. </p>

This trip takes you through beautiful alpine meadows, through massive lava flows and then up two 10,000 ft. volcanoes.  You will sleep in the col between the two peaks.

    <p>Directions to trailhead:
    Drive 16.7 miles from the turnoff of HWY 126 near Santiam Pass.</p><p>Note: As you can see from the GPS track we were forced to start our trip further down the Scenic Highway due to a gate being closed from fallen trees.  We simply walked the couple miles up the trail and then headed into the woods via a lava flow to cut off a bit of the trail.  To start directly from the Obsidian trailhead start from where the GPS track hits the road at the higher elevation where you will find parking. </p><p>A Northwest Forest Pass is required to park here. </p>

  title: French Pete Creek Trail

  sub_title: Easy hike through along French Pete Creek, through old growth timber.
  overview: <p>The French Pete Creek trail is in an old-growth forest valley in the Three Sisters Wilderness. French Pete Creek flows beside the trail. The forest is made of gargantuan Douglas firs and 1000-year-old cedars.</p><p>The passage of the Wilderness Act in 1964 created new wilderness areas and controversy over the management for the new areas. This also marked the establishment and growth of an activist environmental movement. The movement is best known for the controversy surrounding the area's addition to the wilderness area.</p><p>In 1957, the Secretary of Agriculture lifted French Pete from protection. Debate on whether to once again protect the 19,200 acres of French Pete from logging started in the mid-1960's, but legislation for it was not introduced until 1974. The controversy continued until 1978, when the area was included into the Three Sisters Wilderness.</p><p>It was in 1968 that logging plans in the French Pete area were announced. Most people were opposed to these plans, and the Save French Pete Committee was founded. It appealed the logging proposal in court, but the appeal was rejected, and instead the logging &quot;would be delayed to allow more time for public discussion.&quot;</p><p>After that came a period of intense debate and political pressure. The U.S. Forest Service had a tradition of encouraging logging in Oregon's unprotected forests. It planned to log at least 3 million board feet of timber if the area was not protected, so that the logging industry &quot;is to survive the mounting demands from preservationists to stop logging scenic areas.&quot;  There was also concern that banning logging would pose the risk of a large wildfire, because many of the area's trees were diseased or had been killed by beetles. As Springfield, Oregon, forester Dave Burwell said, &quot;It will be a very short time until the happenstance of lightning once again starts a fire that will wipe out the countryside.&quot;</p><p>In 1972, U.S. Senator Wayne Morse (D-OR) hiked into the area with environmental activists and encouraged the Republican who defeated him in the past election, Mark Hatfield, to do the same. After his hike, Morse expressed confidence that the area would be protected, whereas Hatfield still supported opening the area to some logging. However, Hatfield later changed his mind and began to generally support wilderness designation in the United States. </p>
  tips: <p>Head East of Eugene/Springfield on Highway 126 for about 40 miles to Cougar Reservoir (Forest Road 19).  Keep right on Aufderheide Dr around the Reservoir.  When you come to the end of the Reservoir you will cross over a bridge and keep going right.  In about a mile you will see a sign for French Pete Creek Campground.  Turn left for the trailhead (the campground is to the right) </p>

  sub_title: Loop trail past Tumalo Falls, Doulble Falls, Upper Falls, North Fork Falls and Spring Creek Falls
  overview: <p>The viewpoint for Tumalo Falls is a few steps from the parking lot or a short trail to the top. The top is a must worth the 5 minute walk.</p><p>The 89 foot fall along Tumalo Creek is one of the tallest and most beautiful waterfalls in Central Oregon. The area around the falls experienced a forest fire 25 years ago. The USFS has developed viewpoints both at the top and near the base of the falls making the views easy for everyone.</p><p>The exact origin of the word Tumalo is not known. According to the book Oregon Geographic Names, there are three possibilities; one is that is is from the Klamath Indian word Temelo, meaning wild plumb - which were at one point abundant in south central Oregon. Another Klamath word, Temola, meaning ground fog, could have been used to describe the nature of the Tumalo Creek area or perhaps the mist generated by the falls. A third, and most logical in our opinion, is that the original name may have been Tumallowa, which is said to mean icy water - an adjective which fits considering Tumalo Creek is fed by glacial melt.</p><p>Beyond Tumalo Falls you can continue along the river to Double Falls.  Many people stop here and turn back around.  </p><p>If you continue on you will see 3-5 more waterfalls but you will have to ford the creek (unless you can find a fallen log to cross)</p><p>After you ford the creek you will come across the Bend Watershed.  There is no camping allowed inside the watershed.</p><p> </p>

  sub_title: Via Green Lakes and Northwest Ridge
  overview: <p>On this hike we took the long route around Broken Top past Green Lakes to ascend the complete Northwest Ridge and then return via a loop trail to the lakes on the descent.  To be honest we had trouble finding the shorter trail up on the way and ended up climbing the whole ridge.  A shorter option would be to follow the shorter route up to where it meets the ridge and continue from there.  The upper part of the ridge is extremely steep and exposed.  Many suggest using a rope and using protection.  Do this, especially if you have any fear of heights.  We did it without ropes.  On the return definitely take the trail directly down from the ridge to Green Lakes as it will save time.  The rocks on the summit are some of the most beautiful I've ever seen on a climb.  Bring a rugged camera. </p>
  tips: <p>Start from the Green Lakes/Fall Creek Trailhead.  To get there drive west on the Cascade Lakes Highway 24 miles then turn onto forest service road 370 across from Dutchman Flats. Drive 4 miles up this road until you see signs for Forest Service Road 380.  Take a left onto that (this road is terrible).  As you can see from the gps track we decided to head off from a parking lot just off 370 instead of trying to tackle that road. </p>

The hike to the top is very difficult, but fairly easy as far as climbing mountains can go, as there is indeed a trail that goes all the way to the top and can be done without any technical mountain climbing gear.</p><p>The hike can easily be done in a day, and usually takes between 7 and 10 hours round trip.  The hike to the top is about 6 and a quarter miles long (12 round trip) with a 4900 feet elevation gain.</p><p>The mountain itself is a volcano that is around 50,000 years old and last erupted 2000 years ago.</p><p>As you hike you will pass Moraine Lake, and the Lewis and Clark glaciers.  At the top of the South Sisters you will find Oregon's highest lake Teardrop Pool. </p>
  tips: '<p>To get to the trailhead at Devils Lake take Cascade Lakes Highway #46 28.7 miles west from Bend.  It''s a little over 6 miles past Mt Bachelor Ski Area.</p><p>Make sure you bring lots of water.  On a cloudy day you will easily go through 2 quarts of water.  3-4 quarts are recommended on a hot day.  There are a few lakes along the route that you can fill up at if you have a filtration system.</p><p>Bring lots of food.  This is a grueling steep hike and you will need your energy.</p><p>The temperature can vary greatly from the trailhead to the summit.  Pay attention to the weather forecasts.  Even in August, if a cold front comes through it can get down into the 30''s at the top.  If so bring a jacket, hat and gloves.</p><p>Bring good hiking boots and think about gators to protect your shoes from filling up with the loose sand and rocks that are the bane of many hikers on South Sister.</p><p>Bring a good hiking stick, or hiking poles.  You''ll find it very useful both going up and coming down the steep trail.</p><p>Be smart, if there is a cloud at the top of the mountain there may be a blizzard inside.  Don''t take unnecessary risks.</p><p>Stay off Lewis glacier.  Untrained hikers have ventured out onto the glacier and fallen into crevices 40 feet down. </p>'

    <p>The Willamette Valley seduces not only those of us who call this place home but also those adventurers who have heard tales of her siren call. Verdant hills with rows of lustrous grapevines marching from peak to vale, mint-green fields, stately firs spiring skyward, and a passion for stewardship of the valley's natural abundance create our legendary &quot;green&quot; reputation. From Eugene's innovative urban landscape to Springfield's historic district to the close-knit communities of Cottage Grove, Junction City, Veneta, Coburg, Creswell and Lowell, this region beckons those who seek the Pacific Northwest experience.
    In both city and countryside you will want to savor our justly-renowned pinots, stroll the farmers' markets bright with seasonal bounty, and rub shoulders with artists who derive much inspiration from their surroundings. Enjoy the sweet sensation of cycling along bikeways that follow the riffling Willamette River, through diverse wetland birding habitat, gardens and parks. Bring your clubs for a leisurely round of golf at one of our in-town courses or play a quick 9 holes followed by tastings at a few Wineries of Lane County.</p><p>Lane County rests at the southern end of the Willamette Valley, which extends from Cottage Grove north to West Linn, and lies nestled between the Coast and Cascade mountain ranges.</p><p>Oregon Wine Country is the place to visit for additional information on this fertile environment, and the Oregon Wine Board has the latest on wineries throughout the state. For a look at the Willamette Valley region from a wider perspective, you simply must Travel Oregon. We've fallen hard for Willamette Valley's many charms, and we know you will too! </p>

Hike to the oak platform along the nationally recognized Woodpecker Loop Trail to enjoy wonderful views across the Willamette Valley. Or visit the McFadden Marsh observation blind to view numerous migratory waterfowl in the winter.</p><p>A great way to visit the refuge and see various types of wildlife during the winter months is by driving along the Auto Tour Route . This road winds through the middle of the Refuge taking you past wetlands, creeks and ponds that migratory birds call home in the winter. Follow the road to the south end of the refuge to see hundreds of birds on McFadden Marsh, geese feeding on the fields and Pigeon Butte</p><p>Fishing is allowed from May 1 through October 31 in designated areas.

  tips: <p>To reach the William L. Finley National Wildlife Refuge, travel south 10 miles from Corvallis or north 7.5 miles from Monroe, to milepost 93 on Highway 99W. Turn west on Finley Road. </p><p>Dawn and dusk are the best times to see wildlife. In warmer climates, little is moving on hot summer afternoons or windy days. </p><p>Cars make good observation blinds. Drive slowly, stopping to scan places wildlife might hide. Use binoculars or a long lens for a closer look. </p><p>Try sitting quietly in one good location. Let wildlife get used to your presence. Many animals that have hidden will reappear once they think you are gone. Often you will hear more than you will see. </p>

  seo_title: cascadia-park-amp-lower-soda-creek-waterfall-trail
  sub_title: Short easy hike to Lower Soda Falls.  Nice large campground and wading in the South Santiam River.
  overview: <p>This state park has a lot to do with camping at Cascadia campground, swimming in the Santiam River and a short hike to the long thin Lower Soda Creek Falls.</p><p>It used to be the location of a hotel and resort back in 1896, based on the &ldquo;curative powers&rdquo; of the mineral spring water along Soda Creek. Visitors trekked to the remote spot to drink from the bubbling spring. At the height of the resort&rsquo;s popularity in the early 1900s, an average of 1,000 people a week stayed at the hotel and in the camping area. If you look closely you can find a pipe with the orange spring water still flowing out.</p><p>The main campground has 25 first-come, first served tent sites tucked into the trees and rhododendrons. Two reservable group tent areas are near the South Santiam River. If you only have time for a short visit, there are plenty of picnic tables in two day-use areas. Drinking water is available in all areas, as well as flush toilets.</p><p>Look for a small trailhead sign and a bench as you drive into the main day-use parking area. This is the take-off point for a 3/4-mile trail that leads to the 150-foot Soda Creek waterfall. The dirt trail is moderately steep. Look for several varieties of ferns, wildflowers and big Douglas-fir, cedar and maple trees. </p>
  tips: <p>To get here take Hwy 20 14 miles east of Sweet Home.  Between milepost 41 and 42 look for the Cascadia State Park sign and turn north across a bridge.  Keep right and park at the picnic area. </p>

This trail was opened to bikers around 2004 and quickly became one of the more popular loop trails for mountain bikers in the Portland Area.   You'll have views of Mt. Hood from several places and you can even take a swim in the lake on hot days.  Be warned that in the rainy season these trails can become pretty muddy.  If you have time and have brought your binnoculars this is also a great place for bird watching with observation decks along the lakeshore for viewing.  There are plenty of parking areas off the road around the lake.  You can choose whichever one you'd like to start at and the trail is pretty easy to follow.  The consensus is that the best direction to travel on bike is clockwise around the lake. </p>
  tips: '<p>There is a day pass rate of $5 to park within the area which can be picked up at the booth as you enter the park.  From Forest Grove follow the signs for Hagg Lake.

  tips: <p>The Saddle Mountain State Park entrance is located just past mile post 10 going East on Hwy 26 from Seaside. The trail head is 7 mile from the entrance to the park.

  seo_title: burney-falls-and-the-burney-creek-headwaters-trail
  sub_title: McArthur-Burney Falls Memorial SP
  overview: |-
    <p>A fairly simple hike on well developed trails. The steeper portions in areas heavily traveled tend to be paved, with steps and low rock walls where needed. This loop walk provides plenty of views of both the falls and Burney Creek.</p><p>Up towards the North Eastern corner of California midway between Mt. Shasta and Mt. Lassen is a spot Theodore Roosevelt once proclaimed as &quot;the eighth wonder of the world.&quot; It's Burney Falls, a truly magnificent 129 foot waterfall a short run upstream from Lake Britton. This is one of the California State Parks that's a bit more remote but that's not a problem. It's a long but simple drive out of Redding through some great scenic country, ending just outside the small lumber town of Burney.</p><p>The surrounding park is within the Cascade Range and the sparsely populated Modoc Plateau region. McArthur-Burney Falls Memorial SP contains 910 acres of forest and five miles of stream side and lake shoreline on Lake Britton. </p><p>One of the interesting facets of the landscape is that volcanic action was the dominant force shaping this part of California. Burney Creek just doesn't appear to support the water needed to supply the falls, rather, most of the flow percolates through the porous lava rock in subterranean rivers. One of these underground aquifers feeds both Burney Creek and exits the surrounding cliffs into Burney Falls itself. While the falls ﬂow continuously year round, Burney creek is sometimes dry half a mile upstream.</p><p>The Park ﬂora also illustrates the volcanic origins of the region. Understory bushes are muted and sparse in this region compared to other areas. One of the primary reasons is that the soil is porous and the water quickly escapes below the shallow roots of the vegetation that would normally grow in this region. </p><p>Several Native American groups, particularly the Ilmawi Band of the Pit River Tribe, had villages in the region around the present-day park. They were known to use the technique of digging deep pits in order to trap big game animals. The nineteenth-century explorers and local settlers referred to these people as Pit River Indians in reference to this hunting technique. The falls were considered, and still are, both a deep cultural and spiritual landmark.</p><p>This region in the late 19th Century became economically important with the introduction of logging which continues to this day. In the early 20th Century, the Pit River's damming for hydo-electric generation and particularly the Pit River #3 Dam resulted in Lake Britton. A further planned dam nearly obliterated Burney Falls. Fortunately the landowner, Frank McArthur donated the falls in 1922 along with the surrounding land to the State Park system. The park honors McArthur's pioneer parents, John and Catherine McArthur. </p><p>The initial steep journey down to the falls base can get fairly crowded but as most park visitors aren't hikers, traffic thins to a trickle as one crosses the canyon for the rest of the trip. It's a good idea to bring at least a sweatshirt town to the fall's base, the spray cools the canyon considerably, you'll want a daypack as well to stash the clothing and carry both water, a snack, and insect repellant.</p><p>Heading up the opposite side of the canyon can be a long trudge for youngsters. Once at the top of the falls, the Burney Falls Loop Trail levels out. </p><p>HINT: The Fisherman's Bridge provides a major shortcut back to the Visitor Center or better yet, the General Store for that soft-serve ice cream bribe you gave the kids.</p><p>Upper Burney Creek's trail isn't difficult but provides numerous short rises and falls in the trail and broken shade. There's also plenty of easy access points to the creek for fishing.

  sub_title: 'Descend into the dark volcanic underworld of the Subway Cave lava tube for a short yet highly memorable hike. '
  overview: <p>Twenty thousand years ago and just 15 miles north of Lassen Volcanic National Park, the ground broke apart and huge volumes of volcanic rock poured forth to create the enormous expanse that is the Hat Creek Lava Flow.</p><p>Exposed to the air, the top of the lava flow began to cool and solidify, while molten rock below continued to flow - insulated by the now solid roof and creating lava tubes which carried the red-hot rock miles from its source.</p><p>Subway Cave is a section of lava tube less than a third of a mile long, located between two areas of ceiling cave-ins.  Substantial concrete steps have been constructed at both ends of the cave, providing easy access for all would-be spelunkers. </p>
  tips: |-
    <p>&bull; Flashlights are a necessity in the cave. Forgetful folk may be able to rent them from the information center at Old Station, just south of the Subway Cave park.
    &bull; Take a jacket with you if you feel the cool conditions in the cave may be uncomfortable.
    &bull; Open from May to October due to winter weather restrictions.
    &bull; A very short return hike is also available which double-backs across the top of the tube to the entrance near the parking lot. </p>

See our links below to National Park Service information on road and trail closures.\n&bull; Bug repellent is a necessity early in the summer season when mosquitoes are rife.\n&bull; Cinder Cone is popular with backpackers since it's only 11 miles from Lassen peak, yet to reach it by car requires a 40 mile drive from the North park entrance.  Despite the distance we think this day-hike is well worth the extra miles, thanks to the great scenery en route.\n&bull; The last seven miles of the journey is along a dirt road, which when snow-free is entirely accessible even in a two-wheel drive car with relatively low ground clearance.\n </p>"

  overview: |-
    <p>Four hours north east of San Francisco and an hour from the nearest interstate highway, &quot;off the beaten track&quot; is a phrase that could've been coined for Lassen Volcanic National Park. Overlooked by locals and visitors alike the place is something of a treasured secret to those in the know, and should you choose to visit you&rsquo;ll find tranquil surroundings even on the busiest holiday weekends.</p><p>The tranquility of the park belies its true violent nature, however. Situated at the southern-most point on the Cascade Range evidence of volcanic activity is everywhere in this park, including examples of all four types of volcano (plug dome, shield, cinder cone and stratovolcano).</p><p>The most prominent landmark in the park at 10,457 feet above sea level is Lassen Peak, also recently the most explosive landmark, when in 1915 witnesses observed explosive eruptions from the summit which cast volcanic ash up to 200 miles away.</p><p>Our day hikes leave you spoiled for choice and provide several entirely different experiences each worthy of your attention.  Near the middle of the park, combining Lassen Peak and neighboring Bumpass Hell into a single day will give you experiences to remember, or you could check out the great hike up Brokeoff Mountain, or walk around a string of pristine lakes.</p><p>Further away from the center of the park, an excursion to Cinder Cone is a great day out, and if you have the time check out the spectacular Chaos Crags rockfall.</p><p>Tips:
    &bull; Summer through fall is the best time to experience this trail. Snow covers the Lassen landscape for much of the year, closing roads and obscuring trails. See our links below to National Park Service information on road and trail closures.
    &bull; Camping is the way to go at Lassen, although the nearby towns of Mineral and Chester offer some motel opportunities. </p>

  overview: "<p>On a clear day the short and easy 2 mile loop hike around sparkling Manzanita Lake is the perfect introduction to Lassen Volcanic National Park, showcasing as it does some the best features of the park - including the glacier strewn Lassen Peak and the young Chaos Crags massif. In fact it was an enormous rockfall collapse of Chaos Crags which cut off a local creek and created this lake - be sure to check out our Chaos Crags guide for a tour of the rockfall known as Chaos Jumbles.</p><p>This spot is favored not only by hikers and photographers but also fishing enthusiasts in search of rainbow, brown and brook trout. Thankfully the lake is limited to non-motorized boats, keeping the lakeside relatively quiet.  Kayaks can be rented near the boat launch area - check the nearby campground store for details.</p><p>Situated by the northern entrance of the park, the lake is conveniently located by the historic visitor center and the large Manzanita Creek campground. Noise from the park road does infiltrate the peace of the lake somewhat, but its the price you pay for the convenience (see our Cluster Lakes guide if you prefer a quieter lake experience).</p><p>Elevation gain: \n&bull; 300ft (from 5,800 to 6,000ft) </p>"
