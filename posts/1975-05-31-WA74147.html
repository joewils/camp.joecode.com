orientationDescription: <p>The Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest is defined by its diverse landscapes, boasting high, glaciated alpine peaks, lush valleys of old-growth forest and rugged</p><p>shrub-steppe country.</p><p>More than 700 lakes and mountain ponds dot the glacier-carved terrain of nearby Alpine Lake Wilderness. Tree-covered valleys give way to rocky ridges and rugged peaks</p><p>along the crest of the Cascades. Many peaks and slopes are permanently cloaked in snowfields. From wet forests of Douglas fir, cedar and mountain hemlock, the</p><p>landscape opens up to expansive meadows and dry forests of ponderosa pine and grasses.</p><p>Seasonal changes envelop the area as snowmelt gives rise to springtime wildflowers, and autumn colors welcome a landscape blanketed with snow. The area surrounding the cabin is home to abundant wildlife, including deer, squirrels, black bears, mountain lions and migratory birds.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The nearby Ingalls Way Trail allows hikers to enjoy stunning views of Mt. Stuart and the Enchantments. Fishing is possible in nearby streams.</p><p>Up to 24 inches of snowfall in a 24 hour period is not uncommon in this area, making it a winter wonderland for cross-country skiing, backcountry snowboarding and</p><p>snowshoeing. Snowmobiling is possible on the weekends when logging operations are not taking place in the area.</p>
