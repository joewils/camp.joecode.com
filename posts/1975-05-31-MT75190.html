description: <p>Yellow Mule Cabin was built in 1920 and was once used as a ranger station. This cabin is unique because it was constructed according to the builder&amp;#39;s preference instead of</p><p>being built with a standard Forest Service design. It is eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.</p><p>The cabin provides a rustic, backcountry retreat year-round. A few basic amenities are provided, so guests should be prepared to bring most of the supplies and gear</p><p>they need for an enjoyable experience.</p><p> This remote cabin is not accessible by car. Summer access is via off-road vehicle, motorcycle or hiking for 8 miles. Winter access is by snowmobile for 14 miles.</p>
drivingDirection: <p>From Bozeman, Montana, head south on Highway 191. Continue for 5 miles past Big Sky to Buck Creek Ridge Road 2599 (aka Doe Creek Road). Please note that this road is rough and may not be suitable for some low clearance vehicles. During the winter months, park just beyond the cattle guard and snowmobile14 miles to the cabin. Buck Creek Ridge Road is closed to all motorized travel, except snowmobiles, from December 2nd through June 15th.</p><p>During summer, you can proceed another 4 miles to the trailhead. From the trailhead, the cabin is another 8 miles.</p><p>In winter, follow the groomed snowmobile trail up to the ridge, then follow the ridge to the Yellow Mule Cabin sign.In the summer months, from the trailhead, follow the trail markers up the ridge and to the cabin sign (follow ATV track to cabin).The cabin sits about 300 yards down a draw and is NOT easily visible from the ridge.This is a long but gentle trip until you reach the top of the draw above the cabin. If it is storming and you are not familiar with the terrain, please do not try togo to the cabin. The trip can be difficult in a storm even if you know the route.</p>

Basic cookware, utensils, a propane lantern and a</p><p>dining table with chairs are available.

orientationDescription: <p>The cabin sits between a meadow and a stand of mixed evergreens at an elevation of approximately 8,650 feet. Wildflowers bloom across the meadow in the summer and a</p><p>thick layer of pristine snow blankets the area in winter. The jagged, glaciated peaks of the Madison Mountain Range stretch out into the distance.</p><p>Wildlife in this area includes grizzly bear, gray wolf, mountain lion, deer, elk, moose, bighorn sheep and the Canada lynx.
