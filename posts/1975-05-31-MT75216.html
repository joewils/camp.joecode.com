description: <p>Hogan Cabin is a small cabin located on the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail in western Montana. The cabin was built in the 1920s to provide field quarters for trail crews, smoke chasers, timber cruisers and grazing inspectors that worked in the area.</p><p> It is a great retreat for snow lovers in the winter, as the cabin provides access to a variety of snowmobiling, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing trails. Summer and fall months give guests plenty of daylight and moderate temperatures to explore the surrounding meadows, peaks and valleys, as well as fish in plentiful mountain streams.</p><p>The cabin can be accessed by vehicle throughout most of the year. Guests may have to snowmobile, hike or ski up to six miles, depending on conditions. Guests are</p><p>responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.</p>
drivingDirection: '<p>Travel west on Highway 43 from Wisdom, Montana for about 25 miles. From this point, there are 4 separate access routes depending on conditions and preference.</p><p>Access 1</p><p>Forest Service (FS) Road #1260: This road takes off from the Chief Joseph Pass sign. The first mile is for skiers only. The remaining road is shared by both skiers and snowmobiles. The route is marked with blue and orange diamonds. This route is recommended for the novice or inexperienced skier. The total distance is 6 miles.</p><p>Access 2</p><p>Shoofly Trail #101B is the shortest route into Hogan Cabin and also the most difficult. This trail takes off from the parking area along Highway 43 by the Cabinet Creek sign. There are a few sections with steep pitches and most of the difficult sections are tree-lined. If you choose the Shoofly Trail, consideration should be given to snow conditions and skier experience. This trail is marked with blue diamonds.</p><p>Access 3</p><p>Shoofly Alternate: This trail leaves the Shoofly trail from the north end of the meadow and it rejoins Shoofly at the top of the hill. The Shoofly Alternate offers skiers going to Hogan Cabin a more gentle ascent of the hill. If snow conditions are poor when you are returning from the cabin or you are not comfortable with the faster downhill that Shoofly offers, this route may be advisable. It is marked by blue diamonds.</p><p>Access 4</p><p>Trail Creek Road #106 is the main snowmobile route into the area and is marked with orange diamonds. It is also the flattest route into Hogan Cabin. Skiers should expect encounters with snowmobiles if they use this route. It is 6 miles to Hogan Cabin on this road.</p><p>A</p><p>map</p><p>of the area may be necessary to reach the cabin and can be purchased by calling the Wisdom Ranger District.</p>'

The entire length of the trail covers 4,600 miles, showcasing some of the most beautiful and rugged areas of America.</p><p>Hunting and fishing are also popular in the area.
