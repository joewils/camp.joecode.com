importantInformation: '<p> This is NOT a State Park. This is a Josephine County Park. Payment in full is required. Cash is the only method of payment accepted at the park. Generators off at 8pm. Campsite fees include 1 vehicle. Any additional vehicles will be charged $5 per night at the park. There are no showers at this park. Wolf Creek will be closed October 3, 2012 - May 12, 2013 and October 1, 2013 - May 15, 2014. November 1 through March 31:Dry camp only. No water. Vault toilets available. Early departures require the camper to notify the Park Host or the Josephine County Park office to receive a refund of any unused nights. Outside structures, such as jump houses, rock walls, water slides, swimming pools, etc., are NOT permitted in Josephine County Parks campgrounds or picnic areas. No exceptions. No beer kegs are allowed in any campsite. Pets may not be left unattended in vehicles in campsites. *Reservations for more than five nights/days that are later changed to fewer nights/days will be charged a fee equal to the nightly/daily site fee for each night/day canceled as well as the $8 transaction fee. Please be aware that only the person whose name is on the reservation may access, change or cancel the reservation. Maximum camping days are 14 consecutive days. Campers must leave for three days and may return to a County park for an additional 14 days. Twenty-eight total days is the maximum for any six-month period. Customers who wish to secure more than one site within a park for a continuous date period in order to accommodate their reservation request (i.e. split reservation), should be aware that the $8.00 reservation fee would apply to each site reserved. Again, fee adjustments will not be made after reservations have been confirmed using the internet reservation service. If you are viewing inventory and find you are unable to secure one site to accommodate your request please consider calling the call center at 1-800-452-5687 to make your reservation. Reservations can be made 24 hours a day, from 2 days to 9 months in advance. Campsite availability is based on call center hours, meaning sites become available when the call center opens giving no preference to online users versus phone-in customers. Call center hours are: Monday through Friday 8am to 5pm. NOTICE: Oregon law (ORS 105.682, et seq.) provides the owner of land is not liable in contract or tort for injury death or property damage that arises out of use of the land for recreational purposes (known as &amp;quot;recreational use immunity&amp;quot;). That immunity from liability does not apply if the owner makes a charge for permission to use the land. Fees charged for a particular use in this park, such as camping, do not apply to other uses of the park, or to your ability to enter other areas of the park. Therefore, Josephine County is not liable for injuries, death or property damage arising out of any use of this park for recreational purposes when no specific charge has been made for that use or for the right to enter that part of the property.</p>'
