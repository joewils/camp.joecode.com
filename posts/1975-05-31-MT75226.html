description: <p>The Vigilante Cabin, also known as the Vigilante Middle House, offers a comfortable place to stay deep in the mountains of southwestern Montana. The cabin</p><p>used to be a guard station and boasts two bedrooms, a kitchen, living room and electricity. It is close to many outdoor recreation opportunities, including fishing,</p><p>hiking and hunting, as well as off-road vehicle trails and gold panning.</p><p>The cabin and two adjacent buildings were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the early 1920s. The white clapboard middle house is available for rent, while the two other houses on the property are still used by Forest Service personnel and volunteers throughout the year.</p><p>The cabin is accessible throughout most of the year by vehicle; however, a portion of the road may be difficult to navigate when wet or snow-covered. Guests are</p><p>responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring some of their own amenities.</p>
drivingDirection: <p>From Sheridan, travel south on Highway 287 for about 10 miles to Alder. Turn south on Ruby River Road and continue about 22 miles to Vigilante Station. The last 20 miles are on a gravel road, which can be slippery when wet or snow-covered. The gate lock code is the same as the cabin.</p><p>Maps</p><p>of the area may be purchased by calling the Madison Ranger District.</p>
facilitiesDescription: <p>The large, two-bedroom cabin has a bunkbed and single bed with mattresses in each bedroom to sleep up to six people. It has electric lights and a water heater. The</p><p>kitchen is equipped with a range, refrigerator, table and chairs, cookware and utensils. A wood stove heats the cabin, and firewood is provided.</p><p>The living room is fully furnished, and there is a functioning bathroom during the summer months, with running water, a sink, shower and a flush toilet. The</p><p>bathroom is sealed off when the water system at the cabin is winterized. A concrete outhouse with vault toilet is available east of the house. Picnic tables, a grill</p><p>and a group fire ring are located nearby.</p><p>Guests need to bring their own water from October to May. Other items to bring include bedding, pillows, towels, soap, matches, flashlight and garbage bags, among other</p><p>necessities. Guests are asked to replenish the supply of split wood and kindling, pack out all food and garbage, and clean the cabin prior to leaving.</p>
