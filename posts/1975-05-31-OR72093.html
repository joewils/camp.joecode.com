Several tribes throughout the area built &amp;quot;wickiups,&amp;quot; shelters made from reeds, grass, or brush, while living in the area.</p><p>At full pool, Wickiup is a beautiful, pine-edged lake, with some willows and sandy beach areas. At low water, steep soil and gravel banks drop abruptly to the water.</p><p> This is one of central Oregon&amp;#39;s best wildlife viewing sites, attracting a variety of nesting and migrating birds. Fantastic nearby peaks, lava flows and old-growth forests also provide visitors with a variety of landscapes.</p><p>Wetlands, diverse forests, and rocky slopes near the campground provide a necessary habitat for shorebirds, porcupine, deer, bats and the occasional black bear.</p>

The reservoir also sustains good numbers of kokanee and coho salmon and decent populations of rainbow trout, brook trout, whitefish and chub.</p>
