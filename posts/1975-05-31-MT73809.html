note: ''
orientationDescription: <p>The campground is conveniently located near Highway 93, at an elevation of about 4,820 feet. It is named for the numerous scarred ponderosa pine trees in the area. Native American populations that once lived in or frequented the area stripped the trees of bark to expose and extract the tree&amp;#39;s sweet cambium layer for food. The trees remain historically significant and provide shade to the campground.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Visitors enjoy a variety of recreational opportunities, including hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding. A number of trails can be accessed from the campground, including the Nez Perce National Historic Trail. The 3.1-mile trail begins near the turnoff to the campground and follows a portion of the original Nez Perce route. Explorers in the early 1800s also used the route, and wagon ruts are still visible along parts of the trail. The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail is also nearby.</p><p> Fishing is available in nearby Camp Creek. Anglers will find mostly cutthroat trout but other species are available. A variety of wildlife, including big game like mule and white-tailed deer, elk and moose, makes its home in the area.</p>
