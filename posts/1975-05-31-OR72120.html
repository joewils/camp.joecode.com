The wide river flows through areas of old growth ponderosa and aspen, with its shoreline varying from marshy meadows to basalt bedrock. Flows fluctuate less on this part of the river because of tributaries, and the river features many deep pools, a more stable bank and rocky in-stream structure.</p><p>Wildlife found in the area include deer, porcupine, native fish and migratory birds.</p>

Only non-motorized boating is permitted on the river, and the water is Class II flatwater for about 6 miles below Sunriver.</p><p>The Deschutes River is renowned for its fly fishing, and sustains populations of kokanee, rainbow, bull and brown trout. Boat fishing or drift fishing is the best way to catch fish at this part of the river.</p>
