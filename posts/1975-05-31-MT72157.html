The tower contains a few modern amenities, including electricity, but allows guests to personalize their visits with their own supplies.

drivingDirection: <p>In the town of Seeley Lake, turn west on Riverview Drive halfway between MM 13 &amp;amp; 14. Drive straight on the paved road for 0.6 mile, where you will cross over the Clearwater River. Continue on the same road another 0.6 mile where the road will split, stay straight (do not go right). The road will narrow, become more rocky and rough. Proceed almost 1 mile where you will make a right turn. After another 0.2 mile, make another right turn. Go another 0.2 mile and turn right again on Forest Road 696. Continue 1 mile where you will come to the lookout gate. Proceed through the gate (using the gate combination number) and in 0.1 mile you will be at the lookout.</p>
