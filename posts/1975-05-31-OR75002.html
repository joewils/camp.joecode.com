orientationDescription: <p>The Ludlum House is somewhat secluded and surrounded by a towering old-growth forest, with an expanse of lawn stretching out before it. Within an 1.5 hour drive from the house, guests have access to the rugged southern Oregon and northern California coasts and further south, the</p><p>Redwood National Park .</p><p>The nearby Winchuck River flows into the Pacific Ocean about 0.5 miles north of the Oregon and California border and approximately 5 miles south of Brookings, Oregon. Five major tributaries, Wheeler Creek, East Fork, Fourth of July Creek, Bear Creek and South Fork, make up the Winchuck River system. Mt. Emily, at 2,926 feet, is the highest point in the basin.</p><p>Diverse landscapes provide habitat for a wide-range of wildlife, including black-tailed deer and an occasional black bear, to squirrels and salmon. Sensitive wildlife species such as Spotted Owl and Marbled Murrelet are present in the watershed as well. These species, along with many others, depend on the surrounding undeveloped wilderness, undisturbed wetlands, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Hiking, wildlife viewing and fishing top the list of recreational opportunities in the area surrounding the Ludlum House.</p><p>Just steps away from the banks of the Winchuck River, the cabin provides fantastic fishing opportunities for Coho salmon, Chinook salmon, cutthroat trout and steelhead trout. The river is closed to fishing above the Wheeler Creek confluence to provide a refuge for wild fish, but anglers will some excellent steelhead waters below this point, including several miles on the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest. Standard winter steelhead tactics such as drift fishing, floating jigs, or swinging flies work well on this gravel and cobble-bottomed river. Flies such as spruce flies or bucktail streamers work well for sea-run cutthroat.</p><p>The Oregon Redwoods Trail provides a unique accessible hiking opportunity through a grove of majestic old-growth redwood trees. Guests will have the opportunity to learn about old-growth tree ecology, fire history, wildlife, and botany in the area along Peavine Ridge in the Winchuck River drainage.</p><p>Redwood trees in this area represent the only coastal redwoods found in the Pacific Northwest Region, located at the limit of their northern range. The trail is an out/back design with a short loop at the far end, where a picnic stop is provided. A short wooden deck provides access to the inside of a hollowed redwood tree.</p>
