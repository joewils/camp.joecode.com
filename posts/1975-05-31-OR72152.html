orientationDescription: <p>South Shore is located in the high desert landscape with views of Mt. Jefferson as a scenic backdrop. Juniper trees and sagebrush dot the landscape. The combination of a low forest canopy and 3,000 ft. elevation make this a perfect location for stargazing at the wide open sky on clear nights. Eagles and other birds inhabit the shoreline of the lake.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Haystack Reservoir is a popular fishing spot for a variety of species, including kokanee, rainbow trout, largemouth bass, black crappie and brown bullhead catfish. The lake is cool, but a comfortable temperature for swimming. Motorized boating is allowed. Boat launches are located at nearby Haystack and West Shore day use areas. The surrounding national grassland also provides ample opportunities for hunting, hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking and riding off-highway vehicles.</p>
