description: <p>Goose Lake Campground is situated among a mix of mature cedars and Douglas firs within the Mount Adams Ranger District of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.</p><p>This spot becomes popular in late summer and early autumn, when the weather is warmer and dryer, and bald eagles and osprey can be observed hunting for fish on Goose Lake.</p><p> The 58-acre lake is characterized by the somewhat haunting presence of old trees rising from its cool, clear waters. Formed abruptly when a lava flow from Big Lava Bed dammed a nearby stream, this curious sight is all that remains of the trees that were consumed by what is now Goose Lake.</p>
