description: <p>Summit Guard Station Bunkhouse sets the stage for a truly relaxing getaway. Located on the breaks of Meacham Canyon in Umatilla National Forest, spectacular views of the Blue Mountains are guaranteed. The rustic bunkhouse, built by the Civilian Conservation Corps, dates back to 1938.</p><p>The site of the cabin was the Summit Ranger Station in 1908, when the land was part of the Wenaha National Forest. Wenaha was one of the first national forests in the country, established in 1907. It was renamed Umatilla National Forest in 1920.</p>
drivingDirection: <p>The lookout is located about 41 miles southeast of Pendleton, Oregon. From Pendleton, follow I-84 east toward La Grande, Oregon for about 34 miles to Exit 243 (Mt. Emily Exit). Take the off-ramp, turn left at the stop sign and proceed straight ahead. The road becomes Forest Road 31 at the cattle guard. Follow FR 31 for about 12 miles to the junction with FR 3113. Turn left onto FR 3113 and follow for about 1 mile. Turn left onto FR 3113-015. Stay to the right and follow the road back to the cabin (about 0.1 miles) on the right side of the road.</p><p>Generally, Summit can be accessed by vehicle from mid-May to mid-November, and parking is available at the cabin.</p>
facilitiesDescription: <p>The single-room cabin accommodates up to four guests. The red, wood framed cabin has four beds with mattresses, a table and four chairs, and is equipped with a propane cook stove, propane lights and a propane heater. The cabin is stocked with a limited supply of pots, pans, eating utensils and cleaning supplies. A vault toilet is located a short distance from the cabin and additional guests may use the yard to pitch a tent.</p><p>No water is available on-site, so guests must bring plenty of water for drinking, cooking and washing. Other items to bring include food, bedding, towels, garbage bags, dish soap and a first aid kit. It&amp;#39;s a great idea to bring binoculars as well.</p><p>Click here</p><p>for more cabin details.</p>
