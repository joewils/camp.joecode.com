orientationDescription: <p>Situated on the west side of the Cascades between the Canadian border and Mt. Rainier National Park, Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest is one of the most spectacular in the the country, showcasing glacier-covered peaks, wide mountain meadows and old-growth forests, rich in history and outdoor opportunities.</p><p>On a clear day, visitors will see Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area.</p><p>Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, the active volcano from which the forest takes its name, is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers.</p><p>Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.</p><p>Old-growth forests line the wide, gently-flowing river, known for its salmon run.</p><p>Salmon and other species including, chinook, coho, chum, pink, and sockeye salmon, steelhead trout, sea-run cutthroat, and bull trout, use the Stillaguamish and its tributaries for spawning.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest has 1,500 miles of trails, ranging from smooth paths through deep, quiet forests to challenging ascents up boulder-studded mountains. Hiking opportunities abound for every skill level.</p><p>The Mt. Dickerman Trail, close to the campground, switchbacks steeply for 3 miles through a dark forest to an alpine meadow, which was replanted in 1915 after a major forest fire. From this point, the trail rises above the timberline to an alpine meadow alive with masses of wildflowers in July and August.</p><p>The trail is generally in good condition, and spectacular views can be seen from all directions as the trail climbs to the 5,723 foot summit.</p>
