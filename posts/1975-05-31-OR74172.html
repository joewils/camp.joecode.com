description: <p>Musick Guard Station is located in a remote setting in southwestern Oregon, offering visitors a glimpse into a historic mining community in Umpqua National Forest. Situated atop a narrow forested ridge between Fairview Peak and Grouse Mountain, the guard station and outbuildings were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1934 to provide fire protection to the Bohemia Mining district.</p><p> Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Musick Guard Station became an important public contact point and administrative center for the Forest Service. Later it was used as summer barracks for trail crews and firefighting crews. The Guard Station was named after the nearby Musick Mine, a major gold producing mine in the late 1800s and early 1900s.</p><p>Today the guard station continues to offer visitors a unique lodging experience and plenty of opportunities for relaxation and recreation.</p>

Learn more about</p><p>bear safety.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>For hiking and sightseeing, the nearby Bohemia Mountain Hiking Trail leads up a steep grade to the rocky summit of Bohemia Mountain, the highest point on the Cottage Grove Ranger District. Just east of the summit along a ridgeline hikers will be treated to dramatic views of the Cascade mountains and a splattering of wildflowers blooming along rock meadows and bluffs in late June through early August.</p><p>For history buffs and fortune seekers, Musick Mine, one of the most productive gold mines in the district during the late 1800s and into the early 1900s, is a point of interest not to be overlooked. The area is named after James &amp;quot;Bohemia&amp;quot; Johnson, a mountaineer and prospector, who discovered gold-bearing quartz in 1863. The discovery created much short-lived excitement in the valley, but settlers soon realized the gold had to be extracted from the rock by machinery, not panned from the many streambeds, and by 1910 most of the ore had been removed. Some mining continues today.</p>
