orientationDescription: <p>The campground&amp;#39;s widely-spaced sites are scattered in a beautiful section of old-growth forest, where many sit on the banks of the White River, which is sourced by flowing water from ice caves at the base of Emmons Glacier on Mt. Rainier.</p><p>The Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest showcases rugged peaks, sparkling alpine lakes and old-growth forests. Several designated wilderness areas surround the forest.</p><p>Mt. Rainier, the highest peak in Washington and the Cascades Range, dominates the landscape on clear days. The volcano rises to an elevation of 14,411 feet and is perpetually snow-capped, boasting a total of 36-square miles of snowfields and glaciers.</p><p>Wildlife in the area ranges from mountain goats in the higher elevations to porcupines and pine martens in the forests. Migratory birds and native fish find ample habitat in the varied ecosystems.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The White River sustains populations of salmon and trout, making it a great spot for fishing. A natural spring flows through the campground as well.</p><p>Hiking and climbing top the list of recreational activities in the surrounding area. The 0.5-mile, accessible John Muir Nature Trail begins at nearby Dalles Campground. Visitors enjoy gazing up the &amp;quot;Big Tree,&amp;quot; at an old-growth Douglas fir tree inside Dalles. This giant measures 9.5 feet in diameter and is over 700 years old. The tree stands at the beginning of the Dalles River View Trail, originating at the west end of the campground loop.</p><p>Local Crystal Mountain Trail begins about five miles southwest of the campground.
