importantInformation: '<p>Sites have specific alerts and information about what each can accommodate. Please make sure your site accommodates your camping equipment. If you reserve a yurt, please look for your access combination in the Security Alerts section of your confirmation letter. The registered camper will be responsible for the activities of all users of the site. Vehicles must register and pay fees within a half hour of arrival. Vehicles on park property between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. are subject to fees. Extra vehicle fees are not included in Pre-Paid Reservation Fees. Vehicles towed into the campground must use a legal towing device to qualify for exempt fees. All vehicles, RVs, utility and boat trailers must park on pavement. If you do not fit on the pavement, you will be asked to park in the day-use area with paid permit. Visitors must park in day use. Note listed day-use hours. Discovery Season (Oct. 1 - Apr. 30) Hookups: A loop sites reservable late May - October. B and C loop sites reservable late May - September. Hookup sites B1 and B2 are reservable year-round and are kept snow free. Electricity and sewer only. Other hookup sites may be available on first-come-first serve basis, but may not be plowed. Due to weather, water may be shut off to campsites through May 14th. Non-Hookups: There are several reservable non-hookup sites with snow plowed driveways. Others may be available first-come-first serve, but may not be plowed. Yurts: Open and reservable all year. Showers and Restrooms: There are showers and flush toilets in a heated building in the Group Tent camping area. Access through the D loop and path between sites D21 and D22. Water Availability: Frost-free spigots at D6 and Yurt D19 Mt. Howard. Dump Station: Closed for winter season. Dump Station available in Enterprise, Oregon. Day Use Areas: Open during posted times. All restrooms and facilities are closed for winter season. Boat launch may not be accessible. *Reservations for more than five nights/days that are later changed to fewer nights/days will be charged a fee equal to the nightly/daily site fee for each night/day canceled as well as the $8 transaction fee. Please be aware that only the person whose name is on the reservation may access, change or cancel the reservation. You can stay 14 consecutive nights in a single campground, and may return after spending at least three nights out of the park (it can be another state park campground; in fact, we recommend you DO select another state park campground). The maximum time allowed within any Oregon State Park is 14 nights within any 17 night period. Customers who wish to secure more than one site within a park for a continuous date period in order to accommodate their reservation request (i.e. split reservation), should be aware that the $8.00 reservation fee would apply to each site reserved. Reservation fee adjustments will not be made after reservations have been confirmed using the internet reservation service. If you are viewing inventory and find you are unable to secure one site to accommodate your request please consider calling the call center at 1-800-452-5687 to make your reservation. Discount programs which may be offered through the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department cannot be processed when making an internet reservation. For additional information on discount programs call the OPRD Information Center at 1-800-551-6949 or visit us online at www.OregonStateParks.org. Reservations can be made 24 hours a day, from 2 days to 9 months in advance. Campsite availability is based on call center hours, meaning sites become available when the call center opens. Call center hours are: Monday through Friday 8am to 5pm.</p>'
