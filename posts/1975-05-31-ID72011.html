description: <p>Lookout Butte has a history that spans nearly 80 years and has been home to three lookout towers. The first, built in 1923, was 45 feet tall with just a platform on which to stand. A cabin was put on the tower a couple years later. In 1935, a 50-foot tower was constructed. A new tower was built beside the old one in 1962, and this is currently available for rent.</p><p>The current 60-foot wooden tower offers panoramic views and the perfect setting for enjoying the area&amp;#39;s tranquility and natural beauty. Guests can enjoy the scenery from the exterior catwalk or from inside the single-room cabin.</p>

Cross the Selway Bridge, drive 3.5 miles and cross the Swiftwater Bridge on your right. Follow the signs 13 miles for about 1 hour to the lookout.</p><p>An alternate route involves traveling 6.5 miles upriver from the Selway Bridge, cross the O&apos;Hara Bridge on the right and follow the signs for about 1 hour to the lookout. The last quarter mile can be traveled in a conventional vehicle at low speed and with caution.</p>
