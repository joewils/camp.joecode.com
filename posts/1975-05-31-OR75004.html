description: <p>Step into the Butler Butte Cabin and step back in time to the days of WWII, when the threat of forest fires wasn&amp;rsquo;t just from lightning strikes.</p><p>Butler Butte Cabin sits at an elevation of 5,500 feet in an open grassy understory, hemmed in by old-growth forests and sub-alpine meadows. In spring, meadows welcome a pallet of lush green grass and wildflowers, and in fall, vivid colors mark the changing of seasons. The forest showcases a variety of old-growth pine, fir and cedar.</p><p>Located in the Tiller Ranger District in southwestern Oregon, the cabin offers relaxation and recreation for visitors in the spring and summer.</p><p>A 4-wheel drive or high clearance vehicle is recommended. The roads are not plowed in the winter. During an average winter, up to a five-mile snowmobile, cross country ski, or snowshoe excursion is often required to reach the cabin; and guests must bring several of their own supplies.</p>
drivingDirection: '<p>Butler Butte Cabin is at 5,500 feet elevation and receives snow. The roads to the cabin are not plowed, nor are they maintained for passenger cars. A four wheel drive vehicle is recommended. Guests may have to snowshoe, cross country ski or snowmobile up to 5 miles to reach the cabin (not provided).</p><p>Please contact the Ranger District at 541-825-3100 prior to arriving at the cabin to check on any restrictions or conditions (no cell service in Tiller), such as fire or road closures, weather or storms that may affect the quality of your visit.</p><p>Click here</p><p>for current local weather conditions.</p><p>Entry to the cabin is by combination number, provided in confirmation letter. The combination lock on the door has five black vertical buttons. The top button is number one and the bottom button is number five. Please call the Tiller Ranger District at least four days prior to your arrival at the cabin to confirm the combination.</p><p>From Canyonville take West 1st Street and turn onto SE 3rd St/OR-227. Continue to follow OR-227 approximately 23 miles until you reach Tiller. From Tiller, take Douglas County Road #46, which becomes South Umpqua Road, Forest Service Road #28, 5 miles to Jackson Creek Road Forest Service Road #29. Follow Forest Service Road #29 for 9.7 miles to the junction with Forest Service Road #2925. (On the right) Follow Forest Service Road #2925 for 6.5 miles to the five-way junction of Forest Service Roads #2925, #600, #700, and #800. From here there is a choice of two routes:</p><p>For the first route, follow Forest Service Road #800 for 2.5 miles to the junction with Forest Service Road #810 and then follow the road to the cabin.</p><p>This is the shortest and most direct route; however, be aware that the Forest Service Road #800 is an old logging road with water bars cut into it and may not be the best choice for passenger cars.</p><p>For the second route, follow the Forest Service Road #700 approximately six miles to the junction with the Forest Service Road #800 at Tucker Gap. The Forest Service Road # 700 and Forest Service Road # 800 form a big loop and this is where they rejoin. At this point make a sharp switchback turn to the right, onto the Forest Service Road #800. Follow the Forest Service Road #800 for two miles to the junction with the Forest Service Road # 810 and then follow the Forest Service Road # 810 to the cabin.</p>'

note: ''
orientationDescription: <p>Built in 1942 as an Aircraft Warning System (AWS) Station, this site served as a strategic location to watch for invading Japanese planes and balloons loaded with incendiary devices meant to set American west coast forests ablaze. Observers staffed this mountaintop station, watching for signs of invasion or fire. A 20-foot lookout tower, built in 1932 for fire observation, was used for lookout purposes by AWS from early 1942. After the threat of invasion subsided the lookout and cabin were used solely for fire observation. The lookout was burned prior to 1958, as it was no longer used.</p><p>Large mammals such as elk, deer, black bear, and cougar, as well as the smaller residents, squirrels, fox, raccoons and bats are supported by the diverse forest habitat in the area. Learn more about</p><p>bear safety. </p>
