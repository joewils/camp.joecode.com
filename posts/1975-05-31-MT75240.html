orientationDescription: <p>The rustic, remotely located cabin is adjacent to Douglas Creek, in the north end of the Flint Creek Range. It is situated in a grassy meadow, surrounded by mature evergreen trees. The cabin was built in the 1960s and was used as an administrative location for crews working in the area.</p><p>The Flints have typical Rocky Mountain fauna, including a few mountain goats. The area is popular for hunting of deer, elk and blue grouse. Dozens of alpine lakes in the range provide good fishing. Bears may also frequent the area.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>Fishing is popular in any of the mountain lakes in the vicinity. Access to the lakes will require extensive hiking.

Hunting for deer, elk and upland game birds is popular in the area.</p><p>Guests also enjoy snowmobiling, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in the surrounding areas during the winter. Various weather conditions can increase avalanche danger in the area and visitors are encouraged to carry proper backcountry equipment, including a beacon, shovel and probe, while recreating.</p>
