importantInformation: '<p>December 9th through 13th, 2014 there will be a forest thinning project operation in the campground of Jessie M. Honeyman Memorial State Park. Campers may experience loud noise during the hours of 8 AM - 5 PM, traffic delays and heavy equipment. If you reserve the meeting hall or a yurt, please look for your access combination in the Security Alerts section of your confirmation letter. ATV users: * ATV Access from the park only October 1 through April 30 (discovery season). * H Loop (sites 350 - 417) is the ONLY access point for ATVs. * Campers MUST stay in the H Loop to access the dunes. *NO DAY STAGING ALLOWED. GUESTS MUST GO TO THE SOUTH JETTY FEDERAL AREA TO STAGE. All other campers in the park with ATV must trailer out to the South Jetty. You CAN NOT trailer your ATVs to the H Loop for dune access. * State Park day-use pass does not cover access to Federal or County area parking for dunes access. * Requires Northwest Forest Service pass or $5 day use fee. ABSOLUTELY NO UNLOADING, OPERATING, OR STAGING OF ATVs DURING PEAK SEASON (May 1 through Sep 30). Day use fee of $5.00 is charged to all non camping visitors to the overnight camp and Cleawox day use area only. No day use fee for East Woahink area including the Woahink meeting hall area.Paid campers have free access to the day use areas. ********** IMPORTANT ********** Limit of TWO vehicles per site. One vehicle is included with your site fee. Extra vehicle is $5.00/night (changing to $7.00 per night May 1, 2014). Overflow parking is ONLY available for utility trailers and second vehicles that do not fit on the parking pad. Campers with additional vehicles, beyond the second, will be required to rent an additional site. All vehicles must park on asphalt. *** All extra vehicle fees are to be paid at park. *** *Reservations for more than five nights/days that are later changed to fewer nights/days will be charged a fee equal to the nightly/daily site fee for each night/day canceled as well as the $8 transaction fee. Please be aware that only the person whose name is on the reservation may access, change or cancel the reservation. You can stay 14 consecutive nights in a single campground, and may return after spending at least three nights out of the park (it can be another state park campground; in fact, we recommend you DO select another state park campground). The maximum time allowed within any Oregon State Park is 14 nights within any 17 night period. Customers who wish to secure more than one site within a park for a continuous date period in order to accommodate their reservation request (i.e. split reservation), should be aware that the $8.00 reservation fee would apply to each site reserved. Reservation fee adjustments will not be made after reservations have been confirmed using the internet reservation service. If you are viewing inventory and find you are unable to secure one site to accommodate your request please consider calling the call center at 1-800-452-5687 to make your reservation. Discount programs which may be offered through the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department cannot be processed when making an internet reservation. For additional information on discount programs call the OPRD Information Center at 1-800-551-6949 or visit us online at www.OregonStateParks.org. Reservations can be made 24 hours a day, from 2 days to 9 months in advance. Campsite availability is based on call center hours, meaning sites become available when the call center opens. Call center hours are: Monday through Friday 8am to 5pm. </p>'
