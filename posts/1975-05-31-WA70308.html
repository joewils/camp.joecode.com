orientationDescription: <p>On a clear day visitors will see Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, the active volcano from which the forest takes its name is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.</p><p>In the springtime, a towering old-growth forest shelters an explosion of area&amp;#39;s common forest flowers such as western trillium, twinflower, foamflower, coralroot and twistedstalk.</p>

The trail contours above the eastern shoreline of Baker Lake, offering glimpses of Mt. Baker with Baker Lake in the foreground.</p>
