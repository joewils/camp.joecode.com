note: ''
orientationDescription: <p>The campground sits alongside the river, in a towering canopy of Douglas fir, cedar and western hemlock, providing abundant shade.</p><p> Rugged peaks, scenic rivers and abundant wildlife define the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and surrounding designated wilderness areas. On a clear day visitors can see Mt. Baker, which rises to an elevation of 10,781 feet. The active volcano is perpetually snow-capped. Mt. Baker&amp;#39;s summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.</p><p>Wildlife in the area ranges from mountain goats in the higher elevations to coyotes and pine martens in the forests. Migratory birds and native fish find ample habitat in the varied ecosystems as well.</p>
recreationDescription: <p>The surrounding area is a prime location for hiking, fishing, picnicking and horseback riding in summer and early fall. In winter, visitors can take advantage of skiing and snowshoeing opportunities.</p><p>A handful of hiking trails lie within a short driving distance, making Tinkham an ideal setting for both individual and family camping excursions. The 0.5-mile Tinkham Discovery Trail is an easy, family-friendly nature path. It weaves through fallen, moss-covered trees to a small pond. Children love investigating the insects, wildflowers and fungi along the trail.</p>
